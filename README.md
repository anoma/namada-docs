# Introduction

This documentation uses [Nextra](https://nextra.site/) and [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/).

## Local Development

1. You need to install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) >= 16.
    - You may be able to install it using your package manager, e.g. `sudo apt install nodejs` or `brew install node`.
2. Run `npm i` to install the dependencies.
3. To run Docs, you can use the command `npm run dev:docs`. To run Specs, you can use the command `npm run dev:specs`. The default development server URL is `http://localhost:3000` but if for some reason it's used by another application, the console will display on which port the server has been started.
