# Storage Interface Specification

## Introduction and approach
Namada nodes provide interfaces that allow Namada clients to query for specific pinned transactions, transactions accepted
into the shielded pool, and allowed conversions between various asset types. 

## Shielded Transfer Query
In order to determine shielded balances belonging to particular keys or spend one's balance, it is necessary to download
the transactions that transferred the assets to you. To this end, the nth transaction in the shielded pool can be
obtained by getting the value at the storage path `<MASP-address>/tx-<n>`. Note that indexing is 0-based.
This will return a quadruple of the type below:

```
(
    /// the epoch of the transaction's block
    Epoch,
    /// the height of the transaction's block
    BlockHeight,
    /// the index of the transaction within the block
    TxIndex,
    /// the actual bytes of the transfer
    Transfer
)
```
`Transfer` is defined as above and `(Epoch, BlockHeight, TxIndex) = (u64, u64, u32)`.
## Transaction Count Query
When scanning the shielded pool, it is sometimes useful know when to stop scanning. This can be done by querying the
storage path `head-tx`, which will return a `u64` indicating the total number of transactions in the shielded pool.

## Pinned Transfer Query
A transaction pinned to the key `x` in the shielded pool can be obtained indirectly by getting the value at the storage
path `<MASP address>/pin-<x>`. This will return the index of the desired transaction within the shielded pool encoded
as a `u64`. At this point, the above shielded transaction query can then be used to obtain the actual transaction bytes.
## Conversion Query
In order for MASP clients to convert older asset types to their latest variants, they need to query nodes for currently
valid conversions. This can be done by querying the ABCI path `conv/<asset-type>` where `asset-type` is a hexadecimal
encoding of the asset identifier as defined in [Multi-Asset Shielded Pool Specification](https://github.com/anoma/masp/blob/main/docs/multi-asset-shielded-pool.pdf).
This will return a quadruple of the type below:
```
(
    /// the token address of this asset type
    Address,
    /// the epoch of this asset type
    Epoch,
    /// the amount to be treated as equivalent to zero
    Amount,
    /// the Merkle path to this conversion
    MerklePath<Node>
)
```
If no conversions are available, the amount will be exactly zero, otherwise the amount must contain negative units of
the queried asset type.
