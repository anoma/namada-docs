# Ethereum bridge

Namada's bridge to Ethereum exists to allow transfers of both fungible and
non-fungible tokens in either direction (Namada $\Leftrightarrow$ Ethereum).

Fungible token transfers roughly implement the [ICS20] spec. Wrapped [ERC20]
tokens are minted on Namada which naturally can be redeemed on Ethereum at a
later time. Furthermore, it allows the minting of wrapped NAM (wNAM) ERC20
tokens on Ethereum. All wrapped fungible assets are burned, when transferred
back to their native platform. When transferred out of their native platform,
fungible assets are held in escrow.

There will be multiple types of events emitted. Validators should
ignore improperly formatted events. Raw events from Ethereum are converted to a 
Rust enum type (`EthereumEvent`) by Namada validators before being included 
in vote extensions or stored on chain.

```rust
pub enum EthereumEvent {
    // we will have different variants here corresponding to different types
    // of raw events we receive from Ethereum
    TransfersToNamada(Vec<TransferToNamada>)
    // ...
}
```

Each event will be stored with a list of the validators that have ever seen it 
as well as the fraction of total voting power that has ever seen it. 
Once an event has been seen by 2/3 of voting power, it is locked into a
`seen` state, and acted upon.

There is no adjustment across epoch boundaries - e.g. if an event is seen by 1/3
of voting power in epoch n, then seen by a different 1/3 of voting power in 
epoch m>n, the event will be considered `seen` in total. Validators may never
vote more than once for a given event.

### Minimum confirmations
There will be a protocol-specified minimum number of confirmations that events
must reach on the Ethereum chain, before validators can vote to include them
on Namada. This minimum number of confirmations will be changeable via 
governance.

`TransferToNamada` events may include a custom minimum number of 
confirmations, that must be at least the protocol-specified minimum number of 
confirmations.

Validators must not vote to include events that have not met the required 
number of confirmations. Voting on unconfirmed events is considered a 
slashable offence.


## Namada Validity Predicates

There will be three internal accounts with associated native validity predicates:

- `#EthSentinel` - whose validity predicate will verify the inclusion of events 
from Ethereum. This validity predicate will control the `/eth_msgs` storage 
subspace.
- `#EthBridge` - the storage of which will contain ledgers of balances for 
wrapped Ethereum assets (ERC20 tokens) structured in a 
["multitoken"](https://github.com/anoma/namada/issues/1102) hierarchy
- `#EthBridgeEscrow` which will hold in escrow wrapped Namada tokens which have 
been sent to Ethereum.

### Transferring assets from Ethereum to Namada

#### Wrapped ERC20
The "transfer" transaction mints the appropriate amount to the corresponding 
multitoken balance key for the receiver, based on the specifics of a 
`TransferToNamada` Ethereum event.

```rust
pub struct EthAddress(pub [u8; 20]);

/// Represents Ethereum assets on the Ethereum blockchain
pub enum EthereumAsset {
    /// An ERC20 token and the address of its contract
    ERC20(EthAddress),
}

/// An event transferring some kind of value from Ethereum to Namada
pub struct TransferToNamada {
    /// Quantity of ether in the transfer
    pub amount: Amount,
    /// Address on Ethereum of the asset
    pub asset: EthereumAsset,
    /// The Namada address receiving wrapped assets on Namada
    pub receiver: Address,
}
```

##### Example

For 10 DAI i.e. ERC20([0x6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f](https://etherscan.io/token/0x6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f)) to `atest1v4ehgw36xue5xvf5xvuyzvpjx5un2v3k8qeyvd3cxdqns32p89rrxd6xx9zngvpegccnzs699rdnnt`
```
#EthBridge
    /erc20
        /0x6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f
            /balances
                /atest1v4ehgw36xue5xvf5xvuyzvpjx5un2v3k8qeyvd3cxdqns32p89rrxd6xx9zngvpegccnzs699rdnnt 
                += 10
```

#### Namada tokens
Any wrapped Namada tokens being redeemed from Ethereum must have an equivalent amount of the native token held in escrow by `#EthBridgeEscrow`.
The protocol transaction should simply make a transfer from `#EthBridgeEscrow` to the `receiver` for the appropriate amount and asset.

### Transferring from Namada to Ethereum

To redeem wrapped Ethereum assets, a user should make a transaction to burn 
their wrapped tokens, which the `#EthBridge` validity predicate will accept.

Once this burn is done, it is incumbent on the end user to
request an appropriate "proof" of the transaction. This proof must be
submitted to the appropriate Ethereum smart contract by the user to
redeem their native Ethereum assets. This also means all Ethereum gas costs 
are the responsibility of the end user.

The proofs to be used will be custom bridge headers that are calculated
deterministically from the block contents, including messages sent by Namada and
possibly validator set updates. They will be designed for maximally
efficient Ethereum decoding and verification.

For each block on Namada, validators must submit the corresponding bridge
header signed with a special secp256k1 key as part of their vote extension.
Validators must reject votes which do not contain correctly signed bridge
headers. The finalized bridge header with aggregated signatures will appear in the
next block as a protocol transaction. Aggregation of signatures is the
responsibility of the next block proposer.

The bridge headers need only be produced when the proposed block contains
requests to transfer value over the bridge to Ethereum. The exception is
when validator sets change. Since the Ethereum smart contract should
accept any header signed by bridge header signed by 2 / 3 of the staking
validators, it needs up-to-date knowledge of:
- The current validators' public keys
- The current stake of each validator

This means the at the end of every Namada epoch, a special transaction must be
sent to the Ethereum contract detailing the new public keys and stake of the
new validator set. This message must also be signed by at least 2 / 3 of the
current validators as a "transfer of power". It is to be included in validators
vote extensions as part of the bridge header. Signing an invalid validator
transition set will be consider a slashable offense.

Due to asynchronicity concerns, this message should be submitted well in
advance of the actual epoch change, perhaps even at the beginning of each
new epoch. Bridge headers to ethereum should include the current Namada epoch
so that the smart contract knows how to verify the headers. In short, there
is a pipelining mechanism in the smart contract.

Such a message is not prompted by any user transaction and thus will have
to be carried out by a _bridge relayer_. Once the transfer of power
message is on chain, any time afterwards a Namada bridge process may take
it to craft the appropriate message to the Ethereum smart contracts.

The details on bridge relayers are below in the corresponding section.

Signing incorrect headers is considered a slashable offense. Anyone witnessing
an incorrect header that is signed may submit a complaint (a type of transaction)
to initiate slashing of the validator who made the signature.

#### Namada tokens

Mints of a wrapped Namada token on Ethereum (including NAM, Namada's native token)
will be represented by a data type like:

```rust
struct MintWrappedNam {
    /// The Namada address owning the token
    owner: NamadaAddress,
    /// The address on Ethereum receiving the wrapped tokens
    receiver: EthereumAddress,
    /// The address of the token to be wrapped 
    token: NamadaAddress,
    /// The number of wrapped Namada tokens to mint on Ethereum
    amount: Amount,
}
```

If a user wishes to mint a wrapped Namada token on Ethereum, they must submit a transaction on Namada that:
- stores `MintWrappedNam` on chain somewhere
- sends the correct amount of Namada token to `#EthBridgeEscrow`

Just as in redeeming Ethereum assets above, it is incumbent on the end user to
request an appropriate proof of the transaction. This proof must be
submitted to the appropriate Ethereum smart contract by the user.
The corresponding amount of wrapped NAM tokens will be transferred to the
`receiver` on Ethereum by the smart contract.

## Namada Bridge Relayers

Validator changes must be turned into a message that can be communicated to
smart contracts on Ethereum. These smart contracts need this information
to verify proofs of actions taken on Namada.

Since this is protocol level information, it is not user prompted and thus
should not be the responsibility of any user to submit such a transaction.
However, any user may choose to submit this transaction anyway.

This necessitates a Namada node whose job it is to submit these transactions on
Ethereum at the conclusion of each Namada epoch. This node is called the
__Designated Relayer__. In theory, since this message is publicly available on the blockchain,
anyone can submit this transaction, but only the Designated Relayer will be
directly compensated by Namada.

All Namada validators will have an option to serve as bridge relayer and
the Namada ledger will include a process that does the relaying. Since all
Namada validators are running Ethereum full nodes, they can monitor
that the message was relayed correctly by the Designated Relayer.

During the `FinalizeBlock` call in the ledger, if the epoch changes, a
flag should be set alerting the next block proposer that they are the
Designated Relayer for this epoch. If their message gets accepted by the
Ethereum state inclusion onto Namada, new NAM tokens will be minted to reward
them. The reward amount shall be a protocol parameter that can be changed
via governance. It should be high enough to cover necessary gas fees.

## Ethereum Smart Contracts
The set of Ethereum contracts should perform the following functions:
- Verify bridge header proofs from Namada so that Namada messages can
  be submitted to the contract.
- Verify and maintain evolving validator sets with corresponding stake
  and public keys.
- Emit log messages readable by Namada
- Handle ICS20-style token transfer messages appropriately with escrow &
  unescrow on the Ethereum side
- Allow for message batching

Furthermore, the Ethereum contracts will whitelist ETH and tokens that
flow across the bridge as well as ensure limits on transfer volume per epoch.

An Ethereum smart contract should perform the following steps to verify
a proof from Namada:
1. Check the epoch included in the proof.
2. Look up the validator set corresponding to said epoch.
3. Verify that the signatures included amount to at least 2 / 3 of the
   total stake.
4. Check the validity of each signature.

If all the above verifications succeed, the contract may affect the
appropriate state change, emit logs, etc.

## Starting the bridge

Before the bridge can start running, some storage may need to be initialized in 
Namada.
