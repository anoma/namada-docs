# Fee system

In order to be accepted by the Namada ledger, transactions must pay fees.
Transaction fees serve two purposes: first, the efficient allocation of block
space and gas (which are scarce resources) given permissionless transaction
submission and varying demand, and second, incentive-compatibility to encourage
block producers to add transactions to the blocks that they create and publish.

Namada transaction fees can be paid in any fungible token that is a member of a
whitelist controlled by Namada governance. Governance also sets minimum fee
rates (which can be periodically updated so that they are usually sufficient)
that transactions must pay in order to be accepted. However, transactions can
always pay more to encourage the proposer to prioritize them. When using the
shielded pool, transactions can also unshield tokens in order to pay the
required fees.

The token whitelist consists of a list of $(T, GP_{min})$ pairs, where $T$ is a
token identifier and $GP_{min}$ is the minimum (base) price per unit gas that
must be paid by a transaction paying fees using that asset. This whitelist can
be updated with a standard governance proposal. All fees collected are paid as
follows:

- The base fee (i.e. the one up to the minimum gas price) is burnt if the fee
  token is the native one or is sent to an internal reserve account if the fee
  token is a foreign one
- The tip (the amount exceeding the minimum gas price) is always sent directly
  to the block proposer, regardless of the fee token (incentive-compatible, so
  that side payments are no more profitable)

## Fee payment

The `WrapperTx` struct holds all the data necessary for the payment of fees in
the form of the types `Fee`, `GasLimit`, and the `PublicKey` used to derive the
address of the fee payer, which coincides with the signer of the wrapper
transaction itself.

Since fees have a purpose in allocating scarce block resources (space and gas
limit) they have to be paid upfront, as soon as the transaction is deemed valid
and accepted into a block (refer to
[replay protection specs](../base-ledger/replay-protection.mdx) for more details
on transactions' validity). Moreover, for the same reasons, the fee payer will
pay for the entire `GasLimit` allocated and not the actual gas consumed for the
transaction: this will incentivize fee payers to stick to a reasonable gas limit
for their transactions, allowing for the inclusion of more transactions into a
block.

Fees are not distributed among the validators who actively participate in the
block validation process. This is because a tx submitter could be side-paying
the block proposer for tx inclusion, which would prevent the correct
distribution of fees among validators. The fair distribution of fees is enforced
by the stake-proportional block proposer rotation policy of CometBFT.

By requesting an upfront payment, fees also serve as prevention against
denial-of-service (DoS) attacks since the signer needs to pay for all the
submitted transactions. More specifically, to serve as a DoS and spam prevention
mechanism, the fee system needs to enforce:

1. **Successful** payment at block inclusion time (implying the ability to check
   the good outcome at block creation time)
2. Minimal payment overhead in terms of computation/memory requirements
   (otherwise fee payment itself could be exploited as a DoS vector)

The protocol executes the fee payment part of a transaction before any of the
inner transactions that compose the batch. By doing this, we make sure to
prevent inner transactions from draining the addresses of the funds needed to
pay fees. The proposers will be able to check in advance that fee payers have
enough unshielded funds and, if this is not the case, exclude the transaction
from the block and leave it in the mempool for future inclusion. This behavior
ultimately leads to more resource-optimized blocks.

As a drawback, this behavior could cause some inner txs to fail because funds
have been moved to the block proposer as a fee payment for another transaction
included earlier in the same block. This is somehow undesirable since inner
transactions' execution should have priority over the wrapper. There are two
ways to overcome this issue:

1. Users are responsible for correctly timing/funding their transactions with
   the help of the wallet
2. Namada forces in protocol that a block should execute transactions right
   after the fee payment operation

If we follow the second option the block proposers will no more be able to
optimize the block (this would require running the inner transactions to
calculate the possible new balance) and, inevitably, some wrapper transactions
for which fees cannot be paid will end up in the block. These will be deemed
invalid during validation so that the corresponding inner transaction will not
be executed, preserving the correctness of the state machine, but it represents
a slight underoptimization of the block and a potential vector for DoS attacks
since the invalid wrapper has allocated space and gas in the block without being
charged due to the lack of funds. Because of this, we stick to the first option.

Fees are collected via protocol for `WrapperTx`s that have been processed with
success; this is to prevent a malicious block proposer from including
transactions that are known in advance to be invalid just to collect more fees.
Note that in this case we imply the correctness of the transaction's `Header`,
i.e. we make sure that this is correct with respect to the constraints that we
impose on it, and we don't validate anything about the actual inner transactions
that could end up failing.

Since a signer might submit more than one transaction per block, the
`process_proposal` function needs to cache the updated balances to correctly
manage fees.

For every transaction in the block, if enough funds are available, these are
deducted from the storage balances of the fee payers and directed to the balance
of the block proposer. If instead, the balance is not enough to cover fees, then
the entire proposed block is considered invalid and rejected, and a new CometBFT
round is initiated.

From the consensus block proposer's address (included in the CometBFT request),
it is possible to derive the relative Namada address for the payment.

The `Fee` field of `WrapperTx` is defined as follows:

```rust
pub struct Fee {
	/// Amount of fees paid per gas unit.
	pub amount_per_gas_unit: DenominatedAmount,
	/// Address of the fee token.
	pub token: Address,
}
```

The signer of the wrapper transaction defines the token in which fees must be
paid among those available in the token whitelist. At the same time, he also
sets the amount which must meet the minimum price per gas unit for that token,
$GP_{min}$ (also defined in the whitelist). The difference between the minimum
and the actual value set by the submitter represents the incentive for the block
proposer to prefer the inclusion of this transaction over other ones. The block
proposer can check the validity of these two parameters while constructing the
block. These validity checks are also replicated in `process_proposal` and
`mempool_check`.

Since the whitelist can be changed via governance, transactions could fail these
checks in the block where the whitelist change happens. For `mempool_check`, the
checks could reject transactions that may become valid in the future or
vice-versa: since we can assume a slow rate of change for these parameters and
mempool and block space optimizations are a priority, it is up to the clients to
track any changes in these parameters and act accordingly.

### MASP fee payment

To provide improved data protection, Namada allows to unshield some funds on the
go to cover the cost of the fee. This also addresses a possible locked-out
problem in which a user doesn't have enough funds to pay fees (preventing any
sort of operation on the chain).

When the transparent fee payment performed directly from the implicit address of
the signer fails, the protocol tries to execute the first transaction of the
batch: if this is a **valid MASP transaction**, it then reattempts to perform
the same exact transparent fee payment operation. If it is successful, the
transaction is accepted, otherwise it gets rejected (possibly the entire block
is rejected if we are validating a new block). So, essentially, MASP fee payment
involves allowing the transaction to unshield some tokens to the balance of the
fee payer to cover the missing amount.

<Callout type="info">
In case of an atomic batch the masp fee payment transaction will be committed even if the batch eventually fails. That is, all the state changes coming from the other inner transactions of the batch will be dropped (as per the default behavior of an atomic batch), but an exception will be made for the fee paying inner transaction that will instead be committed to storage to guarantee that fees are paid.
</Callout>

Since this operation comes before the actual payment, it can be exploited as a
DoS vector. To prevent this, the protocol enforces a maximum gas limit that can
be used for this operation. When the time comes, the protocol picks the gas
limit for this operation as the minimum between the gas available to the
transaction and the protocol parameter; if the transaction runs out of gas, it
gets discarded. If instead it gets applied correctly, the gas meter of the
transaction accounts for the gas used and the execution proceeds.

The spending key(s) associated with this operation could be relative to any
address as long as the signature of the transfer itself is valid.

### Governance proposals

Governance [proposals](../modules/governance.mdx) may carry some WASM code to be
executed in case the proposal passed. This code is embedded into a new
transaction crafted directly by the validators at block processing time and is
not inserted into the block itself. These transactions are exempt from fees and
don't charge gas.

### Protocol transactions

Protocol transactions can only be correctly crafted by validators and serve a
role in allowing the chain to function properly. Thus, they are not subject to
fees and do not charge gas.

## Gas accounting

Gas must take into account the two scarce resources of a block: gas and space.

Regarding the space limit, Namada charges a fixed amount of gas per byte for
every transaction.

The cost of a WASM tx/vp is given by the run time cost of it.

In addition to these, each inner transaction spends gas for loading the WASM
module from storage, compilation costs (of both the tx and the associated,
non-native, VPs) which are charged even if the compiled transactions was already
available in cache, the calls to the exposed host functions and the sections of
native vps that are more computationally complex.

To summarize, the gas for a given transaction can be computed as:

$$\begin{aligned} Gas & = TxSize \\ & + TxHeaderValidationFixedCost \\ & + TxRuntimeCost \\ & + NonNativeVpsRuntimeCost \\ & + NativeVpsExpensiveSections \\ & + HostFnCallsGas\end{aligned}$$

<Callout type="info">
The runtime gas meter instruments WASM modules before their execution to charge gas based on the actual opcodes that get executed.
The actual code that ends up running though, is an optimized version of the one declared in the WASM module.
This leads to an excessive gas being charged for code that runs in the WASM context. The protocol compensates this by adjusting the non-WASM gas costs accordingly by a predefined factor.
</Callout>

Gas accounting is about preventing a transaction from exceeding two gas limits:

1. Its own `GasLimit` (declared in the transaction's header)
2. The gas limit of the entire block

### Tx GasLimit

The protocol injects a gas counter in each transaction and VP to be executed,
which allows monitoring of the exact amount of gas utilized.

As soon as the gas limit defined in the transaction's header is exceeded, the
transaction is immediately terminated and all the modifications applied to the
WAL get discarded.

### Block GasLimit

This constraint is given by the following two:

- The compliance of each inner transaction with the tx gas limit explained in
  the previous section
- The compliance of the cumulative transactions' `GasLimit`s with the maximum
  gas allowed for a block

CometBFT provides a `BlockSize.MaxGas` parameter, and applies some optional
validation in mempool if this parameter is initialized. It doesn't instead
perform any check in consensus, leaving this task to the application itself (see
[CometBFT app spec](https://github.com/informalsystems/cometbft/blob/main/spec/abci/abci%2B%2B_app_requirements.md#gas),
[CometBFT spec](https://github.com/informalsystems/cometbft/blob/main/spec/core/data_structures.md#blockparams)).
Therefore, instead of using the CometBFT provided param (and its mempool
validation), Namada introduces a `MaxBlockGas` protocol parameter. This limit is
checked during mempool and block validation in `process_proposal`: if the block
exceeds the maximum amount of gas allowed, the validators will reject it.
