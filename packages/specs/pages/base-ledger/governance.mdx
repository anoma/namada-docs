# Governance

Before describing Namada governance, it is useful to define the concepts of NAM, validators, delegators, and delegates:

*Cryptoeconomic terminology*
- Namada's economic model is based around a single native token, NAM, which is controlled by the protocol.

*Consensus terminology*
- A Namada _validator_ is an account with a public consensus key, which may participate in producing blocks and governance activities. A validator may not also be a delegator.

Non-validator addresses on Namada are able to bond their tokens. When they do so, they specify a validator which is now responsible for voting on blocks on the bonder's behalf. When doing so, the validator's voting-power is proportional to the sum of its self-bonded tokens and all the bonded tokens from other addesses to their own address.

When an address bonds tokens, the address is able to specify a *delegate*. The respective validator of that address becomes the default *delegate* (explained below) of that address. Similarly, a delegate's `voting-power` (now in terms of voting on Governance proposals, not blocks) is proportional to the sum of its self-bonded tokens and all the bonded tokens from other addresses to their own address.

*Governance terminology*
With the above definitions in mind, we can now define the following terms:

- A Namada _delegator_ is an account that delegates some tokens to a _delegate_ for voting purposes. Any address is either a delegator or a delegate, but not both.
- A Namada _delegate_ is an account that has been given the right to vote on the behalf of a delegator. A delegate may not also be a delegator.

Namada introduces a governance mechanism to propose and apply protocol changes without the need for a hard fork, and to signal stakeholder approval for potential hard forks. Anyone holding some `NAM` will be able to propose some changes in a proposal for which delegators and validators will cast their `yay` or `nay` votes. It will also be possible to attach some payloads to proposals, in specific cases, to embed additional information. 

Governance on Namada supports both `signaling` and `voting` mechanisms. The signaling mechanism is used for changes which require a hard fork, while the voting mechanism is used for changes which merely alter state. In cases where the chain is not able to produce blocks anymore, Namada relies on [off chain signaling](#off-chain-protocol) to agree on a common move.

Further information about delegators, validators, and NAM can be found in the [economics section](../economics.md).

## On-chain protocol

### Governance Address

Governance adds the internal address:

- `GovernanceAddress`

This address contains all the proposals under its address space.

### Governance storage

Each proposal will be stored in a sub-key under the internal proposal address. The storage keys involved are:

```
/\$GovernanceAddress/proposal/\$id/content: Vec<u8>
/\$GovernanceAddress/proposal/\$id/author: Address
/\$GovernanceAddress/proposal/\$id/type: ProposalType
/\$GovernanceAddress/proposal/\$id/start_epoch: Epoch
/\$GovernanceAddress/proposal/\$id/end_epoch: Epoch
/\$GovernanceAddress/proposal/\$id/grace_epoch: Epoch
/\$GovernanceAddress/proposal/\$id/proposal_code: Option<Vec<u8>>
/\$GovernanceAddress/proposal/\$id/funds: u64
/\$GovernanceAddress/proposal/epoch/\$id: u64
```

An epoch is a range of blocks or time that is defined by the base ledger and made available to the PoS system. This document assumes that epochs are identified by consecutive natural numbers. All the data relevant to PoS are [associated with epochs](../economics/proof-of-stake/objects-and-txs.md#epoched-data).

Field semantics are as follows:

- The `content` value should follow a standard format. We leverage a similar format to what is described in the [BIP2](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0002.mediawiki#bip-format-and-structure) document:

```json
{
    "title": "<text>",
    "authors": "<authors email addresses> ",
    "discussions-to": "<email address / link>",
    "created": "<date created on, in ISO 8601 (yyyy-mm-dd) format>",
    "license": "<abbreviation for approved license(s)>",
    "abstract": "<text>",
    "motivation": "<text>",
    "details": "<AIP number(s)> - optional field",
    "requires": "<AIP number(s)> - optional field",
}
```

- The `Author` address field will be used to credit the locked funds if the proposal is approved.
- The `ProposalType` imply different combinations of:
  - the optional wasm code attached to the proposal
  - which actors should be allowed to vote (delegators and validators or validators only)
  - the threshold to be used in the tally process
  - the optional payload (memo) attached to the vote

The correct logic to handle these different types will be hardcoded in protocol. We'll also rely on type checking to strictly enforce the correctness of a proposal given its type. These two approaches combined will prevent a user from deviating from the intended logic for a certain proposal type (e.g. providing a wasm code when it's not needed or allowing only validators to vote when also delegators should, etc...). More details on the specific types supported can be found in the [relative](#supported-proposal-types) section of this document.

- `/\$GovernanceAddress/proposal/\$epoch/\$id` is used for efficient iteration over proposals by epoch. `\$epoch` refers to the same value as the one specified in the `grace_epoch` field.

`GovernanceAddress` parameters and global storage keys are:

```
/\$GovernanceAddress/counter: u64
/\$GovernanceAddress/min_proposal_fund: u64
/\$GovernanceAddress/max_proposal_code_size: u64
/\$GovernanceAddress/min_proposal_period: u64
/\$GovernanceAddress/max_proposal_content_size: u64
/\$GovernanceAddress/min_proposal_grace_epochs: u64
/\$GovernanceAddress/pending/\$proposal_id: u64
```

- `counter` is used to assign a unique, incremental ID to each proposal.\
- `min_proposal_fund` represents the minimum amount of locked tokens to submit a proposal.\
- `max_proposal_code_size` is the maximum allowed size (in bytes) of the proposal wasm code.\
- `min_proposal_period` sets the minimum voting time window (in `Epoch`).\
- `max_proposal_content_size` tells the maximum number of characters allowed in the proposal content.\
- `min_proposal_grace_epochs` is the minimum required time window (in `Epoch`) between `end_epoch` and the epoch in which the proposal has to be executed.
- `/\$GovernanceAddress/pending/\$proposal_id` this storage key is written only before the execution of the code defined in `/\$GovernanceAddress/proposal/\$id/proposal_code` and deleted afterwards. Since this storage key can be written only by the protocol itself (and by no other means), VPs can check for the presence of this storage key to be sure that a proposal_code has been executed by the protocol and not by a transaction.

The governance machinery also relies on a subkey stored under the `NAM` token address:

```
/\$NAMAddress/balance/\$GovernanceAddress: u64
```

This is to leverage the `NAM` VP to check that the funds were correctly locked.
The governance subkey, `/\$GovernanceAddress/proposal/\$id/funds` will be used after the tally step to know the exact amount of tokens to refund or move to Treasury.

### Supported proposal types

At the moment, Namada supports 4 types of governance proposals:

```rust
pub enum ProposalType {
  /// Carries the optional proposal code path
  Default(Option<String>),
  StewardProposal,
  PGFProposal,
  ETHBridge,
}
```

`Default` represents a generic proposal with the following properties:

- Can carry a wasm code to be executed in case the proposal passes
- Allows both validators and delegators to vote
- Requires 2/3 of the total voting power to succeed
- Doesn't expect any memo attached to the votes

`StewardProposal` is a proposal to elect a steward for _Public Goods Funding_:

- Doesn't carry any wasm code
- Allows both validators and delegators to vote
- Requires 1/3 of the total voting power to vote `Yay`

`ETHBridge` is aimed at regulating actions on the bridge like the update of the Ethereum smart contracts or the withdrawing of all the funds from the `Vault` :

- Doesn't carry any wasm code
- Allows only validators to vote
- Requires 2/3 of the total voting power to succeed
- Expect every vote to carry a memo in the form of a `Signature` over some bytes provided in the proposal

`PGFProposal` is a specific proposal to propose transfers for _Public Goods Funding_:

- Can only be submitted by PGF stewards
- Allows both validators and delegators to vote
- Passes by default unless $\frac{1}{3}$ of the total voting power votes on the proposal, AND out of the votes, at least $\frac{1}{2}$ are `Nay`
- Expect every vote to carry a memo in the form of `Set<(Address, BudgetCap)>`

### GovernanceAddress VP

Just like PoS, also governance has its own storage space. The `GovernanceAddress` validity predicate task is to check the integrity and correctness of new proposals. A proposal, to be correct, must satisfy the following:

- Mandatory storage writes are:
  - counter
  - author
  - type
  - funds
  - voting_start epoch
  - voting_end epoch
  - grace_epoch
- Lock some funds >= `min_proposal_fund`
- Contains a unique ID
- Contains a start, end and grace Epoch
- The difference between StartEpoch and EndEpoch should be >= `min_proposal_period`.
- Should contain a text describing the proposal with length < `max_proposal_content_size` characters.
- Vote can be done only by a delegator or validator (further constraints can be applied depending on the proposal type)
- If delegators are allowed to vote, than validators can vote only in the initial 2/3 of the whole proposal duration (`end_epoch` - `start_epoch`)
- Due to the previous requirement, the following must be true, `(EndEpoch - StartEpoch) % 3 == 0`
- If defined, `proposalCode` should be the wasm bytecode representation of the changes. This code is triggered in case the proposal has a position outcome.
- The difference between `grace_epoch` and `end_epoch` should be of at least `min_proposal_grace_epochs`

Once a proposal has been created, nobody can modify any of its fields.
If `proposal_code` is `Empty` or `None`, the proposal upgrade will need to be done via hard fork, unless this is a specific type of proposal: in this case the protocol can directly apply the required changes.

It is possible to check the actual implementation [here](https://github.com/anoma/namada/blob/main/shared/src/ledger/governance/mod.rs#L69).

Examples of `proposalCode` could be:
- storage writes to change some protocol parameter
- storage writes to restore a slash
- storage writes to change a non-native vp

This means that corresponding VPs need to handle these cases.

### Proposal Transactions

The on-chain proposal transaction will have the following structure, where `author` address will be the refund address.

```rust
struct Proposal {
    id: u64,
    content: Vec<u8>,
    author: Address,
    r#type: ProposalType,
    votingStartEpoch: Epoch,
    votingEndEpoch: Epoch,
    graceEpoch: Epoch,
}
```

The optional proposal wasm code will be embedded inside the `ProposalType` enum variants to better perform validation through type checking.

### Vote transaction

Vote transactions have the following structure:

```rust
struct OnChainVote {
    id: u64,
    voter: Address,
    yay: ProposalVote,
}
```

Vote transaction creates or modifies the following storage key:

```
/\$GovernanceAddress/proposal/\$id/vote/\$delegation_address/\$voter_address: ProposalVote
```

where `ProposalVote` is an enum representing a `Yay` or `Nay` vote: the yay variant also contains the specific memo (if any) required for that proposal.

The storage key will only be created if the transaction is signed either by a validator or a delegator. In case a vote misses a required memo or carries a memo with an invalid format, the vote will be discarded at validation time (VP) and it won't be written to storage.

If delegators are allowed to vote, validators will be able to vote only for 2/3 of the total voting period, while delegators can vote until the end of the voting period. If only validators are allowed to vote
for the `ProposalType` in exam, they are allowed to vote for the entire voting window.

If a delegator votes differently than its validator, this will *override* the corresponding vote of this validator (e.g. if a delegator has a voting power of 200 and votes opposite to the delegator holding these tokens, than 200 will be subtracted from the voting power of the involved validator).

As a small form of space/gas optimization, if a delegator votes accordingly to its validator, the vote will not actually be submitted to the chain. This logic is applied only if the following conditions are satisfied:

- The transaction is not being forced
- The vote is submitted in the last third of the voting period (the one exclusive to delegators). This second condition is necessary to prevent a validator from changing its vote after a delegator vote has been submitted, effectively stealing the delegator's vote.

### Tally

At the beginning of each new epoch (and only then), in the `finalize_block` function, tallying will occur for all the proposals ending at this epoch (specified via the `grace_epoch` field of the proposal).
The proposal has a positive outcome if the threshold specified by the `ProposalType` is reached. This means that enough `yay` votes must have been collected: the threshold is relative to the staked `NAM` total.

Tallying, when no `memo` is required, is computed with the following rules:

1. Sum all the voting power of validators that voted `yay`
2. For any validator that voted `yay`, subtract the voting power of any delegation that voted `nay`
3. Add voting power for any delegation that voted `yay` (whose corresponding validator didn't vote `yay`)
4. If the aforementioned sum divided by the total voting power is greater or equal to the threshold set by `ProposalType`, the proposal outcome is positive otherwise negative.

If votes carry a `memo`, instead, the `yay` votes must be evaluated net of it. The protocol will implement the correct logic to make sense of these memos and compute the tally correctly:

1. Sum all the voting power of validators that voted `yay` with a specific memo, effectively splitting the `yay` votes into different subgroups
2. For any validator that voted `yay`, subtract the voting power of any delegation that voted `nay` or voted `yay` with a different memo
3. Add voting power for any delegation that voted `yay` (whose corresponding validator voted `nay` or `yay` with a different memo)
4. From the `yay` subgroups select the one that got the greatest amount of voting power
5. If the aforementioned voting power divided by the total voting power is greater or equal to the threshold set by `ProposalType`, the proposal outcome is positive otherwise negative.

All the computation will be done on data collected at the epoch specified in the `end_epoch` field of the proposal.

It is possible to check the actual implementation [here](https://github.com/anoma/namada/blob/main/shared/src/ledger/governance/utils.rs#L68).

### Refund and Proposal Execution mechanism

Together with tallying, in the first block at the beginning of each epoch, in the `finalize_block` function, the protocol will manage the execution of accepted proposals and refunding. For each ended proposal with a positive outcome, it will refund the locked funds from `GovernanceAddress` to the proposal author address (specified in the proposal `author` field).  Moreover, if the proposal had a positive outcome and `proposal_code` is defined, these changes will be executed immidiately.

For each proposal that has been rejected, instead, the locked funds will burnt (removed from total supply).

To summarize the execution of governance in the `finalize_block` function:

If the proposal outcome is positive and current epoch is equal to the proposal `grace_epoch`, in the `finalize_block` function:
- transfer the locked funds to the proposal `author`
- execute any changes specified by `proposal_code`

In case the proposal was rejected or if any error, in the `finalize_block` function:
- Burn the locked funds

The result is then signaled by creating and inserting a [`Tendermint Event`](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/blob/ab0835463f1f89dcadf83f9492e98d85583b0e71/docs/spec/abci/abci.md#events.


## Off-chain protocol

### Create proposal

A CLI command to create a signed JSON representation of the proposal. The
JSON will have the following structure:

```
{
  content: Base64<Vec<u8>>,
  author: Address,
  votingStart: TimeStamp,
  votingEnd: TimeStamp,
  signature: Base64<Vec<u8>>
}
```

The signature is produced over the hash of the concatenation of: `content`, `author`, `votingStart` and `votingEnd`. Proposal types are not supported off-chain. 

### Create vote

A CLI command to create a signed JSON representation of a vote. The JSON
will have the following structure:

```
{
  proposalHash: Base64<Vec<u8>>,
  voter: Address,
  signature: Base64<Self.proposalHash>,
  vote: Enum(yay|nay)
}
```

The proposalHash is produced over the concatenation of: `content`, `author`, `votingStart`, `votingEnd`, `voter` and `vote`. Vote memos are not supported off-chain. 

### Tally

Same mechanism as [on chain](#tally) tally but instead of reading the data from storage it will require a list of serialized json votes.
