# The Namada SDK

The Namada software development kit (SDK) can be found in the `namada` repo under the path [`namada/crates](https://github.com/anoma/namada/tree/main/crates/sdk). The SDK is written in Rust and can be used to interact with the Namada blockchain, by constructing transactions, signing them, and submitting them to the network.

## Quick Start

A good starting point to see the SDK in use is to check-out the [namada interface](https://github.com/anoma/namada/tree/main/crates/sdk) repo. This repo contains a simple web application that uses the SDK to interact with the Namada blockchain. However, it is important to note the added complexity arising from the application integrating javascript using [wasm-bindgen](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/wasm-bindgen/), which is not necessary.

## Installation

The Namada SDK can be installed by creating a new Rust project and adding the following to the `Cargo.toml` file:


<Expandable>

```toml
[package]
name = "namada-sdk-example"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

# See more keys and their definitions at https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html

[dependencies]
clap = { version = "4.4.2", features = ["derive", "env"] }
rand = {version = "0.8", default-features = false}
rand_core = {version = "0.6", default-features = false}
serde = { version = "1.0.188", features = ["derive"] }
serde_json = "1.0.107"
namada_sdk = { git = "https://github.com/anoma/namada", rev = "v0.31.5", default-features = false, features = ["tendermint-rpc", "std", "async-send", "download-params", "rand"] }
tendermint-config = "0.34.0"
tendermint-rpc = { version = "0.34.0", features = ["http-client"]}
tokio = {version = "1.8.2", default-features = false}
tempfile = "3.8.0"
async-trait = "0.1.74"
markdown-gen = "1.2.1"
reqwest = "0.11.22"
minio = "0.1.0"
itertools = "0.12.0"

[build-dependencies]
vergen = { version = "8.0.0", features = ["build", "git", "gitcl"] }
```

Once the sdk is installed, you can use it to interact with the Namada blockchain.
