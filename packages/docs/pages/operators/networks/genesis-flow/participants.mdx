## Pre-genesis network participants

The pre-genesis network participants are the entities that are participating in the genesis ceremony. The pre-genesis network participants are responsible for:
1. [Generating their public and private keys](#generating-keys)
2. [Submitting their public keys and addresses to the network coordinator](#submitting-keys-and-addresses)
3. [Generating their pre-genesis transactions](#generating-transactions)
4. [Signing their pre-genesis transactions](#signing-transactions)
5. [Submitting their pre-genesis transactions to the network coordinator](#submitting-transactions)

<Steps>

### Generating keys

Before the genesis ceremony begins, the pre-genesis network participants must generate their public and private keys. The pre-genesis network participants must ensure that their private keys are kept secret and that their public keys are submitted to the network coordinator in due time.

This can be done through the namada cli:

```bash
ALIAS="<your-key-alias>"
namadac gen key --alias $ALIAS --pre-genesis
```

After the user has entered their passwords and written down their mnemonic phrase, the namada cli will save the keys to the `pre-genesis` folder inside the [base directory](../../ledger/base-directory.mdx).

In order to print the keys, the user can run the following command:

```bash
# Not recommended in production since it will print the private key to the terminal (which can be recovered)
cat $BASE_DIR/pre-genesis/wallet.toml
```

It is the public keys that the pre-genesis network participants must submit to the network coordinator.

```toml
# Example wallet.toml
[public_keys]
bengt = "ED25519_PK_PREFIXtpknam1qq2vscpcvhdwht9tldj9ntxnknandhnerhzd6d42xqzukw2kpcfpudh3dl2"

...

[addresses]
bengt = "tnam1qq97eqvv4lam8ds00j9em2s2f0r8e7r60qw9fdfq"
```

It is then the right hand side of each of these fields that is submitted to the network coordinator, i.e `ED25519_PK_PREFIXtpknam1qq2vscpcvhdwht9tldj9ntxnknandhnerhzd6d42xqzukw2kpcfpudh3dl2` and `tnam1qq97eqvv4lam8ds00j9em2s2f0r8e7r60qw9fdfq` in the example above.

The network coordinator should specify the schema in which the pre-genesis network participants should submit their public keys and addresses. A toml file with the following schema is recommended:

```toml
[<pre-genesis-participant-alias>]
"public-key" = "ED25519_PK_PREFIXtpknam1qpjs6jrjuu5cj508ys7ezee4r40v8as6vz4j3ddc9qm68nfhf5n7clp4xse"
"address" = "tnam1qq5skuga54tfs7422hzz8sqvk3s6lhe2dg32jjhd"
```

### Submitting keys and addresses

After the network coordinator has published the location (conventionally a git repository) for the pre-genesis network participants to submit their public keys, the participants are expected to submit their generated public keys (and their corresponding addresses) to the network coordinator in due time. The deadline will be set by the network coordinator.

### Generating transactions

Participants are also responsible for generating the genesis-block transactions that set the initial state of the blockchain, including initialising genesis validator accounts and bonding to them. However, it is only possible to make transactions that require value once the balances of the keys become agreed upon (once the `balances.toml` file has been published).

#### Generate an established account

In order to generate a pre-genesis validator account, the pre-genesis network participants must first generate an established account. This can be done through the namada cli:

<Callout>
The `$ALIAS` variable is the alias of the pre-genesis keys that were generated in the [Generating keys](#generating-keys) step.
</Callout>

```bash
#Ensure $BASE_DIR is set to the base directory
TX_FILE_PATH="$BASE_DIR/pre-genesis/transactions.toml"
namadac utils init-genesis-established-account --path $TX_FILE_PATH --aliases $ALIAS

# You can change the `--path` argument to any file path, but the recommended is `$BASE_DIR/pre-genesis/transactions.toml`
```

The command will ouptut the generated address of the established account.

```text
Derived established account address: tnam1q8lsztqqhpjxdwzw88mqqc2mun7dvpxvas3v2dxk
```

It is useful to save this address for later use.

```bash
ESTABLISHED_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS=tnam1q8lsztqqhpjxdwzw88mqqc2mun7dvpx
```

This will generate a `transactions.toml` file that contains the pre-genesis transaction that will establish the account. The `transactions.toml` file should look something like this:

```toml
[[established_account]]
vp = "vp_user"
threshold = 1
public_keys = ["tpknam1qr872zwdvw4u4nkpl0ykmvhyvxw7j0u6g7ymz03d7he0jr3szkuwczddjp2"]
```

#### Generate a pre-genesis multisignature account

In order to generate a pre-genesis multisignature account, simply add multiple `--alias` flags to the command:

```bash
# Ensure $BASE_DIR is set to the base directory
# Assuming that the values of $ALIAS1, $ALIAS2, and $ALIAS3 are the aliases of the pre-genesis keys that were generated in the [Generating keys](#generating-keys) step.
TX_FILE_PATH="$BASE_DIR/pre-genesis/transactions.toml"
namadac utils init-genesis-established-account --path $TX_FILE_PATH --aliases $ALIAS1 --aliases $ALIAS2 --aliases $ALIAS3
```

The command will ouptut the generated address of the multisignature account.


```text
Derived established account address: tnam1q8qvns6ndpff03wmszkhgepk2r8f9ws68ugktfml
```

The corresponding `transactions.toml` file should look something like this:

```toml
[[established_account]]
vp = "vp_user"
threshold = 1
public_keys = ["tpknam1qr872zwdvw4u4nkpl0ykmvhyvxw7j0u6g7ymz03d7he0jr3szkuwczddjp2", "tpknam1qpz5n0u49s6s5jx4nyycyw0w288yfq96p3lvwxkedxyw77y0vd53sqmryce"]
```

#### Generate a pre-genesis validator account

<Callout type='info'>
This step will require the `balances.toml` file to have been published by the network coordinator.
</Callout>

Once the pre-genesis network participants have generated respective pre-genesis established accounts, they can generate their pre-genesis validator accounts. This can be done through the namada cli:

```bash
# Ensure $BASE_DIR is set to the base directory
# Ensure $ESTABLISHED_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS is set
# Ensure $TX_FILE_PATH is set

EMAIL="<your-email>"
SELF_BOND_AMOUNT=1000000 # Set this to the amount of NAM you want to self-bond
VALIDATOR_ALIAS="<your-validator-alias>"
namadac utils init-genesis-validator \
  --address $ESTABLISHED_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS \
  --alias $VALIDATOR_ALIAS \
  --net-address "127.0.0.1:26656" \
  --commission-rate 0.05 \
  --max-commission-rate-change 0.01 \
  --self-bond-amount $SELF_BOND_AMOUNT \
  --email $EMAIL \
  --path $TX_FILE_PATH
```

<Callout type="info">

The `SELF_BOND_AMOUNT` must be less than or equal to the amount of NAM allocated to the pre-genesis keys in the `balances.toml` that was published by the network coordinator. It will correspond to the self-bonded stake of the validator account at genesis.

The `--net-address` specifies the network address of the validator node given by "IP:PORT". It is also possible to use DNS names instead of IP:PORT addresses.

The `--alias` flag is the moniker name of the validator account.

The `--commission-rate` and `--max-commision-rate` flags are the commission rate and the maximum permitted commission rate change of the validator account per epoch. See the validator docsfor more info.

The `--email` flag is the email address of the validator account. This is used for the validator account to receive notifications from the network coordinator and other participants.

The `--address` flag is the Namada address of the account.

The `--path` flag is the path to the `transactions.toml` file that will be appended to, and requires the established account to already be initialised under.

</Callout>

The above command will append the necessary transactions to the `transactions.toml` file. The `transactions.toml` file should look something like this:

Successful execution will output the new validator address:

```text
Validator account address: tnam1q8lsztqqhpjxdwzw88mqqc2mun7dvpxvas3v2dxk
```

### Signing transactions

Once the `transactions.toml` file has been generated, the pre-genesis network participants must sign the transactions. This can be done through the namada cli:

```bash
namadac utils sign-genesis-txs \
    --path $TX_FILE_PATH \
    --output $BASE_DIR/pre-genesis/signed-transactions.toml \
    --alias $VALIDATOR_ALIAS # This is only necessary if a validator account was generated, otherwise leave out the flag entirely
```

The above command will output a `signed-transactions.toml` file that contains the signed transactions.


### Submitting transactions

Once all pre-genesis transactions have been generated and signed, the pre-genesis network participants must submit their transactions to the network coordinator in due time. The deadline will be set by the network coordinator. This will involve simply submitting the `signed-transactions.toml` file to the network coordinator at the agreed upon location.

By convention, a directory for each pre-genesis network participant is created in the git repository. The `signed-transactions.toml` file is then submitted to the respective directory.
