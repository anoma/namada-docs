# Setting up a decentarlised Namada network

Setting up a decentralised Namada network requires coordination between two distinct parties:

1. [The network coordinator](./genesis-flow/coordinator.mdx#the-network-coordinator)
2. [The pre-genesis network participants](./genesis-flow/participants.mdx#pre-genesis-network-participants)

This process is also called the **genesis ceremony**.
