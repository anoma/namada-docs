# Quickstart

Getting started with Namada is as simple as:  

<Steps>
### Install Namada
 
Install the Namada binaries (`namada`, `namadan`, `namadaw`, `namadac`) and place them in your `$PATH`.  

You can [build from source](./install/source.mdx) or [download prebuilt binaries](./install/binaries.mdx) from the Releases page of the Namada Github repo.
[Docker images](./install/docker.mdx) are also available.
 
### Install CometBFT
 
Namada requires CometBFT `v0.37.9` for consensus. [Install CometBFT](./installing-cometbft.mdx) and place it in your `$PATH`.

### Join a Network
 
See the [networks page](../networks.mdx) for details on how to join a network. Joining a network is a one-step process to download the proper genesis files, wasm code and checksums, and initialize your node's storage and configuration.
You can join a [testnet](../networks/testnets.mdx), [localnet](../operators/networks/local-network.mdx), or (soon) [mainnet](../networks/mainnets.mdx).  

You will need to know the chain-id of the network you wish to join. You can then join as a full (non-validator) node by running:
```shell copy
namadac utils join-network --chain-id $CHAIN_ID --add-persistent-peers
```

The newly initialized chain data will be found in your [base directory](../operators/ledger/base-directory.mdx).  

(See the list of all [utilities](../utils.mdx) commands.)

### Run a ledger node

You can start your node with:

```shell copy
namadan ledger run
```
Your node will begin syncing with the chain.
For a more verbose output, one can run:

```shell copy
NAMADA_LOG=info CMT_LOG_LEVEL=p2p:none,pex:error NAMADA_CMT_STDOUT=true namadan ledger run
```
To keep your node running in the background after closing your terminal, you will likely want to use either tmux or a systemd service file.
See the section on [Running a full node](../operators/ledger/running-a-full-node.mdx) for more detail on this, as well as configuration options and environment variables.  

Instead of syncing your own node, you can use a [public rpc](./public-rpc.mdx) for most functionality.

### Wait for your Node to Finish Syncing
This can take several hours depending on the chain height and your system specs.

### Create an Account
 
Create a new [implicit](../users/transparent-accounts.mdx) account in order to receive tokens:

```shell copy
namadaw gen --alias $YOUR_ALIAS
```
This will generate a new account and store it in the default keychain. You can view the account address with:

```shell copy
namadaw list --addr

# Sample output:
Known transparent addresses:
  ...
  "<your-alias>": Implicit: tnam1qzegva94xdnvtahqqetys9zzua6sdlm8sve05r9u
```

{/* #TODO: ADD some output */}

### Get Some Tokens from the Faucet (Testnet Only)
 
Check [here](../networks/testnets/faucet.mdx) for a list of testnet faucets.
(If your testnet is not listed, ask in the Discord server for more info.)

### Explore 🚀

There's a variety of cool things you can do next!
- [Shield some NAM or other tokens](../users/shielded-accounts/shielded-transfers.mdx)
- [Bond (delegate) some tokens to a validator](../users/delegators.mdx)
- [Become a validator yourself](../operators/validators.mdx)
- [Participate in governance by creating or voting on proposals](../users/governance.mdx)
- [Send or recieve tokens from another chain via IBC](../users/ibc.mdx)
</Steps>
