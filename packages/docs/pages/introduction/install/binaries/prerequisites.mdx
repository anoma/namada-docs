## Installing CometBFT

Follow [these instructions](.introduction/installing-cometbft.md) in order to setup CometBFT.

## Installing GLIBC
Finally, you should have GLIBC `v2.29` or higher.

**MacOS**: the system-provided glibc should be recent enough.

**Ubuntu 20.04**: glibc is installed by default and you don't have to do anything more.

**Ubuntu 18.04**: glibc has `v2.27` by default which is lower than the required version to run Namada. We recommend to directly [install from source](./source.md) or upgrade to Ubuntu 19.04, instead of updating glibc to the required version, since the latter way can be a messy and tedious task. In case updating glibc would interest you, this [website](http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/9.0-systemd/chapter05/glibc.html) gives you the steps to build the package from source.
