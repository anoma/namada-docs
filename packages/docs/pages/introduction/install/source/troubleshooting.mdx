# Troubleshooting installation from source

### Not enough RAM
[Building binaries locally](../source.mdx) is a computationally heavy task and will put your computer to the test. The compilation usually requires at least 16 GB of RAM and depending on the optimisation of your machine, could require slightly more (for some machines slightly less). For this reason, compilation can sometimes fail.

The error
```
src/apps/namada lib could not compile due to previous errors. Exited with exit code:
```
is a common error that can sometimes mean your computer ran out of memory when compiling. To resolve this, I have found closing all other applications and recompiling once or twice will do the trick. Otherwise more RAM will be needed.

### Compiling for the first time
Compilation errors due to missing library installations when building the binaries for the first time can be a common problem. 


#### Linker "CC" not found
If one runs into the error

```
Entering directory '/root/namada/wasm/wasm_source'
RUSTFLAGS='-C link-arg=-s'  cargo build --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --target-dir 'target' --features tx_bond && \
cp "./target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/namada_wasm.wasm" ../tx_bond.wasm
   Compiling proc-macro2 v1.0.46
   Compiling quote v1.0.21
error: linker `cc` not found
  |
  = note: No such file or directory (os error 2)

error: could not compile `quote` due to previous error
warning: build failed, waiting for other jobs to finish...
error: could not compile `proc-macro2` due to previous error
```

It may be resolved by running

```bash copy
sudo apt install build-essential
```

Another solution can sometimes be installing `libcland-dev`. This can be achieved through:

```bash copy
sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get install -y libclang-dev
```


#### WASM32-unknown-unknown
Another issue the compiler may run into is that it cannot find the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target.

```
error[E0463]: can't find crate for `core`
  |
  = note: the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target may not be installed
  = help: consider downloading the target with `rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown`

error[E0463]: can't find crate for `compiler_builtins`

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0463`.
error: could not compile `cfg-if` due to 2 previous errors
```

This issue can be resolved by running 

```bash copy
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```
(Yes the name of the target is `wasm32-unknown-unknown`. This is not the compiler unable to tell which version/release it is).

#### OpenSSL

If you run into the error

```
Could not find directory of OpenSSL installation, and this `-sys` crate cannot
  proceed without this knowledge. If OpenSSL is installed and this crate had
  trouble finding it,  you can set the `OPENSSL_DIR` environment variable for the
  compilation process.

  Make sure you also have the development packages of openssl installed.
  For example, `libssl-dev` on Ubuntu or `openssl-devel` on Fedora.

  If you're in a situation where you think the directory *should* be found
  automatically, please open a bug at https://github.com/sfackler/rust-openssl
  and include information about your system as well as this message.
```

Then the solution is spelled out for you. You need to install the development packages of OpenSSL. For Ubuntu, this is `libssl-dev`. For Fedora, this is `openssl-devel`. For other distributions, please refer to the [OpenSSL website](https://www.openssl.org/).

For Ubuntu, this can be achieved through

```bash copy
sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
```
