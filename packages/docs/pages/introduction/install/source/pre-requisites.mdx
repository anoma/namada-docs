# Pre-requisites
If you'd like to install Namada from source you will have to install some dependencies first: 

1. [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) 
2. [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
3. [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/get_started.html)
4. [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/source/)
5. [LLVM](https://releases.llvm.org/download.html)

## Rust
At the end of the installation, make sure that Cargo's bin directory `$HOME/.cargo/bin` is available on your PATH environment variable. You can either restart your shell or run `source $HOME/.cargo/env` to continue.

If you already have Rust installed, make sure you're using the latest version by running:

```shell copy
rustup update
```

## Remaining dependencies
Then, install the remaining dependencies.

{/* TODO: Turn these into code boxes with toggles for OS */}

**Ubuntu:** running the following command should install everything needed:

```shell copy
sudo apt-get install -y make git-core libssl-dev pkg-config libclang-12-dev build-essential protobuf-compiler
```

**Mac:** installing the Xcode command line tools should provide you with almost everything you need:

```shell copy
xcode-select --install
```

`protoc` is also required. On Mac, you can install it with `Homebrew`:

```shell copy
brew install protobuf
```

When running
```shell copy
protoc --version
```
It should output at least:
```shell copy
libprotoc 3.12.0
```

Please refer to [protoc-installation doc](https://grpc.io/docs/protoc-installation/) for other installation options.
