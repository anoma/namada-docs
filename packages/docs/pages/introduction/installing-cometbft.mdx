# Installing CometBFT

In addition to the Namada binaries, it is required to install CometBFT before running Namada.  

## Downloading the latest release
Namada is compatible with CometBFT release `v0.37.11`

You can download the precompiled CometBFT binaries from their [official GitHub repository](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/releases/).
- Download release `v0.37.11` for use with Namada [here](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/releases/tag/v0.37.11).
- While newer versions may be available on the release version, these have not been tested to be fully compatible and should not be used with Namada.

## Adding the CometBFT binary to $PATH
If you have `go` installed and downloaded, you may want to add the CometBFT binary to your `$GOPATH/bin` directory. This can be done by running the following command in the root directory of the repository

```bash copy
cp /path/to/cometbft/binary $GOPATH/bin/
```

Otherwise, we recommend you simply copy it to your `/usr/local/bin` which may require `sudo` permissions.

`sudo cp /path/to/cometbft/binary /usr/local/bin/`

In order to check that the installation was successful, you can run the following command

```bash copy
cometbft version
```

Which should output something like:

```bash copy
0.37.11
```
