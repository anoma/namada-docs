# Mainnets
The Namada mainnet is currently live after having been launched on December 3 @ 15:00 UTC.

The genesis files are hosted in the following repository: https://github.com/anoma/namada-mainnet-genesis.

### Mainnet status and attributes:
- chain ID: `namada.5f5de2dd1b88cba30586420`
- Namada binaries: [`v101.1.1`](https://github.com/anoma/namada/releases/tag/v101.1.1)
- Namada libs: [`v0.150.1`](https://github.com/anoma/namada/releases/tag/libs-v0.150.1)
- CometBFT version: [`v0.37.15`](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/releases/tag/v0.37.15)

### Joining the network from the CLI
The simplest way to join the network is the following:
```
export NAMADA_NETWORK_CONFIGS_SERVER="https://github.com/anoma/namada-mainnet-genesis/releases/download/mainnet-genesis"
export CHAIN_ID=namada.5f5de2dd1b88cba30586420
 
# Download the network files and join
namadac utils join-network --chain-id $CHAIN_ID
```

With these steps, a user can join the Namada mainnet, allowing for querying and transacting on the blockchain.
These beginning steps are necessary for running a full node or a validator node as well.
More details on how to join the network in these cases can be found in [this mainnet guide](https://github.com/anoma/namada-mainnet-genesis/blob/main/MAINNET-GUIDE.md).

### Hard forks
If an operator would like to sync a node from genesis, they must do so by running the appropriate version of the node.
This version historically changes each time there has been a hard-fork of the network.

The following table describes the hard-forks and the corresponding software version needed to sync a block:

| Starting Block Height | Software Version |
|------------------------|------------------|
| 0            | v1.0.0          |
| 894,000      | v1.1.1          |
| 2,176,000    | v101.0.0        |

### Services and infrastructure

There are several places to discover available infra and services with APIs for accessing Namada data.

The primary knowledge base is on [namada.community](https://namada.community/infrastructure-services), which pulls its data from the [namada-ecosystem github repo](https://github.com/Luminara-Hub/namada-ecosystem/tree/main/user-and-dev-tools/mainnet).
This is an actively maintained resource for finding RPC nodes to connect to, active IBC relayers, Namadillo front-end instances, active indexers, state snapshot providers and more.

Block explorers and Namadillo instances can also be found on https://namada.net/apps.
