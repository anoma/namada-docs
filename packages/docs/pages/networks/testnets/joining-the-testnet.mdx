# Joining the latest testnet

Depending on whether you are a genesis validator, you can join the latest testnet either as a genesis validator or as a full node.

## Joining as a genesis validator
Joining the testnet validator is identical to that of a mainnet validator.

For this reason, please refer to [these docs](../../operators/validators/validator-setup.mdx#start-validating).

## Joining as a full node
If you are not a genesis validator, please follow the steps for [joining as a full node](../../operators/ledger/running-a-full-node.mdx). 

It is then possible to test being a validator by [becoming a post-genesis validator](./post-genesis-validator.mdx).
