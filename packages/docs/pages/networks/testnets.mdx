# Live Testnets

Currently, while the Namada mainnet is live and has not reached Phase 5 of the mainnet launch, two public test networks are currently running, housefire and campfire.

### Housefire Testnet
This is a mainnet-tracking testnet and the intended primary staging ground for software upgrades and governance proposals.
Before Phase 5 of mainnet, it is used to test the proposals to advance between the phases.

- chain ID: `housefire-alpaca.cc0d3e0c033be`
- Namada binaries: [`v101.0.0`](https://github.com/anoma/namada/releases/tag/v101.0.0)
- Namada libs: [`v0.149.1`](https://github.com/anoma/namada/releases/tag/libs-v0.149.1)
- CometBFT version: [`v0.37.15`](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/releases/tag/v0.37.15)

### Campfire Testnet
A more experimental testnet that is already configured to have full, Phase 5 functionality at genesis.
This network will be abandoned once the Namada mainnet and housefire testnet reach Phase 5 functionality.

- chain ID: `campfire-square.ff09671d333707`
- Namada binaries: [`v101.0.0`](https://github.com/anoma/namada/releases/tag/v101.0.0)

### Services and infrastructure

The best way to discover infrastructure and services publicly available on the testnets is to consult the files in the [`namada-ecosystem`](https://github.com/Luminara-Hub/namada-ecosystem/tree/main/user-and-dev-tools/testnet) repo.
