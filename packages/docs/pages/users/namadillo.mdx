# Namadillo

<Callout type='info'>
Namada mainnet will gradually enable features in stages. Check https://namada.net/mainnet-launch for more info! Some sections of Namadillo will not be accessible 
until the respective functionality is enabled on mainnet; however, you can experiment with all aspects of Namadillo on [testnet](../networks/testnets.mdx).

Namadillo is a web-based front-end for Namada developed by Heliax. Using Namadillo, along with the [Namada Keychain browser extension](../users/keychain.mdx), 
you can stake, vote in governance, deposit and withdraw assets via IBC, and earn shielded rewards.
