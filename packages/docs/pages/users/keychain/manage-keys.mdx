# Managing Accounts

Follow this quick reference guide to learn how to manage your accounts in the Namada Keychain extension.

## View Your Keys and Addresses
Click the three vertical dots `⋮` next to an account and select "View keys" to display your addresses and public keys. From here, 
you can also click the buttons at the bottom to display your Viewing Key and Spending Key (you will be prompted for your password). 
<Callout type="warning">
Remember: your addresses and public 
keys are safe to share, but your Viewing and Spending Keys should always be kept private!
</Callout>

## Generate a New Payment (Shielded) Address
Each account can generate many thousands of Payment (Shielded) Addresses, and your total shielded balance will be the sum of all 
Payment Address balances belonging to your account. To generate a new Payment Address, first click the three vertical dots `⋮` next to an account and select "View keys." From here, click 
the "Generate Payment Address" button at the bottom of the view. Upon clicking this button, you'll notice the Shielded Address 
displayed directly above has changed.

## View Your Seed Phrase
You can view the seed phrase for an account by clicking the three vertical dots `⋮` next to it in the accounts list and selecting "View Seed Phrase." You'll be prompted for your password 
before the seed phrase is displayed. Note that if you're using a Ledger hardware wallet, this option will not be available because the account seed is tied to the Ledger device.
<Callout type="error">
Never share your seed phrase! Anyone who knows your seed phrase can steal your funds.

## Rename an Account
Click the three vertical dots `⋮` next to an account and select "Rename" to choose a new name.

## Delete an Account
Click the three vertical dots `⋮` next to an account and select "Delete" to remove it from your keychain (you will be prompted for your password). Your account and funds will 
still exist on the blockchain, but you will no longer be able to access it through the Namada Keychain extension until you [import](./add-keys.mdx) it again using its seed phrase.
