# Transferring Assets over IBC

Namada features full IBC protocol support, which means non-native assets can be brought over from any IBC compatible
chain (such as Cosmos SDK chains). As a result, users can enjoy the combined benefits of another chain's ecosystem, assets
and features with Namada's [MASP](./shielded-accounts/).

The assumed prerequisites are that an active IBC connection has been created and maintained between the two chains by
operators running relayer software such as [Hermes](https://github.com/heliaxdev/hermes).  

This section will be focused on IBC transfers from a user perspective. For info on operating an IBC relayer, see 
[this](../operators/ibc.mdx) page in the Operators section.
