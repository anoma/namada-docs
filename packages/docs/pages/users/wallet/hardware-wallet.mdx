# Ledger Hardware Wallet

<Callout type="info">
The Namada Ledger app is not yet updated in the Ledger Live catalogue, so the only way to use one in the meantime is with 1) a Ledger **Nano** device and 2) sideloading as a work-around: [Zondax Hub](https://hub.zondax.ch)
Typically sideloading an unaudited version of the app onto your device is only for testing purposes, but it is effective as a work-around. See the installation instructions below.
</Callout>

Both the [Namada Keychain](./web-wallet.mdx) browser extension and the Namada CLI are compatible with the [Ledger](https://www.ledger.com/) hardware wallet. 
This guide will walk you through the process of setting up your Ledger device to work with Namada.

## Prerequisites
You will need a Ledger device with the latest firmware installed. You can find instructions on how to update your firmware [here](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002731113-Update-device-firmware).

In order to use the Ledger with the web wallet, you will need to install the [Namada Keychain Extension](./web-wallet.mdx#install). To use the Ledger with the Namada CLI, 
you will need to [install the latest version](./../../introduction/install.mdx) of Namada.

## Installing the Namada Ledger app
<Callout type="warning">
The Namada Ledger app is still a work in progress. Use at your own risk. At this preliminary stage of development, it is *highly* recommended that you use a device that 
does not contain any existing funds.  

When installing a Ledger app from any source besides the official app store, you will be shown a warning to that effect and prompted for confirmation. Please make sure you 
understand the risks before proceeding. Before installing *any* app from a non-official source, be sure that you trust the authors and the instructions being given. As always, do your own research.

<Steps>
### Connect your device to your computer 
The remaining steps assume you have already completed the initial Ledger setup and your device is ready to use.

### Uninstall any existing Namada apps on your device

### Visit the Zondax Hub and prepare your device
In your browser, visit the [Zondax Hub](https://hub.zondax.ch). Click the "Connect Device" button in the top right corner, and confirm the connection in your browser and on your device.

### Install the Namada app
Scroll down until you find Namada in the list, and select the newest version from the dropdown. Click "Install" and confirm on your device.

</Steps>

## Using a Ledger with Namada Keychain (browser extension)

You can use the Ledger app with the Namada Keychain browser extension to sign transactions in front-end web apps. **Expert mode must be turned off.**  See the 
[Namada Keychain](./web-wallet.mdx) page for general installation and usage instructions.

Disclaimer: this will only work on Chrome-enabled browsers at the moment.

### Importing (deriving) your Ledger address
Before any other operations with the Ledger, we will want to derive an address and public key and add them to the extension ([web wallet](./web-wallet.mdx)) under an alias for convenience.
To derive your address using a Ledger:

<Steps>
### Open Namada Keychain and click `Add keys`

### Click `Connect hardware wallet`

### Connect your device to your computer and Open the Namada app
Follow the prompts and click `Next` after each step

### Confirm on device
After the following the prompts, your address and public key will be displayed on your device. Confirm the operation on your device.

### Name your Ledger account
Give your account an easy to remember name.

### Click `Finish setup`
</Steps>

### Display your address/public key
To display your Ledger address/public key, first open Namada Keychain. Find your Ledger account in the list, click the `⋮` icon (three vertical dots) and select 'View keys'. 

### Signing a transaction
**Expert mode must be turned off.** To sign a transaction from a front-end app (such as [Namadillo](./../../integrating-with-namada/interface.mdx)), follow these steps:

<Steps>
### Connect your device and open the Namada app

### Set your Ledger as the active account
Open the Namada Keychain and click the checkbox next to your Ledger account to set it as the active account.

### Perform your transaction

### Review transaction
You will be presented with a browser pop-up containing a summary of the transaction. You can click `View data` to see the 
details of what will be submitted on-chain. You can also verify the correct public key is listed under `Signer`. When you're 
ready to proceed, click `Approve`.  

You will be reminded again to connect your device and open the Namada app; click `Submit` to send the signing request to the Ledger.

### Approve on your device
Review the transaction details on your device and click `Approve` to sign and submit the transaction to the chain.
</Steps>

## Using the Ledger app with the CLI
You can use your Ledger to sign transactions from the Namada CLI.
<Callout type="warning">
Make sure the 'expert mode' toggle is set to disabled in the Namada app; this feature has not yet been implemented and may result in crashes.
</Callout>

### Importing (deriving) your Ledger address
Before any other operations with the Ledger, we will want to derive an address and public key and add them to the [file system wallet](./file-system-wallet.mdx) under an alias for convenience.
To derive your address using a Ledger:

<Steps>
### Connect your device to your computer

### Open the Namada app on your device

### Derive your address / public key
This command will derive your address and public key and add them to your wallet under an `alias` of your choosing:
```bash copy
namadaw derive --use-device --alias $ALIAS
```
The default derivation path is `m/44'/877'/0'/0'/0`. You can use the flag `--hd-path` to specify a different derivation path. Use `namadaw derive --help` for more information.

### Confirm in wallet
List your wallet contents with:
```bash copy
namadaw list
```
You should see your address and pubic key listed under the `$ALIAS` you provided. Beside them should be the label `(external)` indicating that they are associated with a device.
</Steps>

### Signing a transaction
Use the `--use-device` flag when you wish to sign a transaction using the Ledger. For example:
```bash copy
namadac transparent-transfer \
  --source $ALIAS \
  --target $DEST_ADDRESS \
  --token $TOKEN \
  --amount $AMOUNT \
  --use-device
```
When constructing the transfer, the CLI will check your wallet for the public key given under `$ALIAS`. You will then be prompted on the device to approve the transaction

### Troubleshooting
As written above, the Namada Ledger app is not yet updated in the Ledger Live catalogue, so the only way to use one in the meantime is with 1) a Ledger **Nano** device and 2) sideloading as a work-around: [Zondax Hub](https://hub.zondax.ch)
Typically sideloading an unaudited version of the app onto your device is only for testing purposes, but it is effective as a work-around.

Some common errors you may encounter while using the Ledger with the Namada CLI:

- `Unable to connect to query address and public key from Ledger: Ledger | App Error: | 21781 [APDU_ERROR] Unknown`  
There is a USB connectivity issue; disconnecting and reconnecting the Ledger will often resolve this.

- The CLI panics with `Message:  Failed to sign transaction` or similar.  
Make sure you're using the correct versions of both the Ledger app and Namada binaries

- The CLI panics with `Message:  No signature could be produced for a transaction of type ...`  
Make sure the Ledger account has been properly [added to your wallet](#importing-deriving-your-ledger-address-1).

- The CLI panics part-way through signing and the Ledger reboots.  
Make sure the `expert mode` toggle in the Ledger app is set to `disabled`.
