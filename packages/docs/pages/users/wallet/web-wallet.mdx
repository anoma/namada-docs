# Web Wallet

## Namada Extension
You can use the [Namada Extension](https://namada.net/extension) to manage your keys within your browser. By connecting the extension with
web apps built for Namada, you can send or recieve tokens, make IBC transfers, or perform other actions such as voting on governance proposals. 

## Installation
The extension is currently available on the [Chrome web store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/namada-extension/hnebcbhjpeejiclgbohcijljcnjdofek), with Firefox support coming soon.

## Set-up
After adding the extension to Chrome, follow these steps to create a new wallet:

<Steps>

### Click 'Launch Initial Set-up'

### Add or create keys
You can choose 'Import existing keys' to import an existing wallet from your twelve word mnemonic. You can also use a Ledger hardware wallet -- see [here](./hardware-wallet.mdx)
for further instructions.  

Click 'Create new keys' and verify that you have read and understood the message to proceed.

### Safely store your mnemonic
You will be shown your recovery mnemonic and asked to confirm that you have written it down.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="❗">
Write your mnemonic down and store it safely offline.  

It will allow you to recover your account. Without it, you risk losing access to your funds forever.
</Callout>

### Create and safely store your password
You will also be asked to create a password for the extension. Write down this password -- you will need to enter it regularly when using the extension.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="❗">
If you lose your password, you will lose access to the extension.

Remember: there's no 'recover password with email' option!
</Callout>

### Complete!
Your wallet is ready to use.
</Steps>

## Using the Extension
The extension itself only provides key management functionality. To send or receive tokens, you will need to navigate to a compatible
web app (such as [namada-interface](https://github.com/anoma/namada-interface)) and connect the extension to the site.  

Here's how to use the extension with Namada-Interface:

<Steps>
### Set the network in the extension
Open the extension and click the 'gear' icon in the top right, then select 'Network'.  

Enter a valid chain-id and rpc url for the chain you wish to transact on, and click 'Submit'.

### Navigate to the Namada-interface site
The Namada-interface for the [Campfire testnet](../../networks/testnets/campfire.mdx) is hosted at [https://interface.luminara.icu](https://interface.luminara.icu). After mainnet
has launched, a list of hosted Interfaces will be found [here](../../networks/mainnets.mdx).

### Connect the extension
Click 'Connect to Namada Extension' and approve when prompted. You should see your wallet balance displayed on the page.

### Interact
Once connected, you can use the Interface to make transfers or stake with a validator (Note: some functionality may be missing on testnet).
Whenever you submit a transaction to the chain, you will be prompted to enter your password to allow the extension to sign using your private key.

### Disconnect
If you wish to disconnect (remove permissions) from a site, you can do so in the Settings menu of the extension, under 'Connected Sites'.
