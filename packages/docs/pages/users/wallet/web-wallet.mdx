# Web Wallet

## Install
When Namada is in `mainnet`, the web wallet will be available in most browser extension web stores. For now, you can install it from source by following the instructions below.

### Installing from source (for development and experiment purposes)

#### Connect to a testnet or run a local node
1. Follow the instructions for the [testnets](../../networks/testnets.mdx) to connect to a testnet or set up a local node using [docker](../../introduction/install/docker.mdx).
2. Figure out where the base directory is stored and save its location as a variable such as `export BASE_DIR=<path/to/base/dir>`.
   You can follow [these docs](../../networks/testnets/migrating-testnets.mdx#after-v0153) to save this variable. Go ahead and save the chain id as a variable as well. You can find the chain id by running `cat $BASE_DIR/global-config.toml`. Save this chain-id to the variable `export CHAIN_ID=<CHAIN_ID>`.
3. You will need to edit the CometBFT config in order to allow the web wallet to connect to your node.
   The CometBFT config will be located in `$BASE_DIR/$CHAIN_ID/cometbft/config/config.toml`. You will need to change the `cors_allowed_origins` field to `["*"]`. You can do this by running
   ```shell copy
   sed -i 's/cors_allowed_origins = \[\]/cors_allowed_origins = ["*"]/' \
           $BASE_DIR/$CHAIN_ID/cometbft/config/config.toml
   ```

#### Setting up the extension
1. Clone the [namada-interface repository](https://github.com/anoma/namada-interface).
2. Follow the installation instructions in `README.md`.
3. `cd` into the `namada-interface/apps/extension` directory and run `yarn start:chrome`. This will build the extension and place it in the `namada-interface/apps/extension/build` directory. It also starts the dev server which will watch for changes.
4. `cd` into the `namada-interface/apps/namada-interface` directory and run `yarn dev:local` in order to launch a local instance of the web wallet.
4. Add the extension to the browser. For example, in Chrome, you can go to `chrome://extensions/` and click `Load unpacked` and select the `namada-interface/apps/extension/build/chrome/` folder.

## Receiving tokens
You can show the address of any account by pressing the `Receive` button in the initial view under the "Total Balances" tab. You can copy the address by clicking the copy icon next to the address.
This will also display a QR code that can be scanned by a mobile wallet.

## Sending Transactions

In order to send transactions, you can press the `Send` button in the initial view under the "Total Balances" tab. This will open a modal that will allow you to send tokens to any account, from any account in your wallet that has a positive balance.
