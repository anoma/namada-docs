# Namada Keychain Browser Extension

You can use the [Namada Keychain](https://namada.net/extension) browser extension to manage your Namada keys/accounts within your browser. By connecting Namada Keychain with
web apps built for Namada, you can send or receive tokens, make IBC transfers, or perform other actions such as voting on governance proposals.  

There's a [dedicated section](./keychain.mdx) in these docs covering the installation, setup, and usage of Namada Keychain. Or, if you prefer video guides, check out the tutorials available on [namada.help](https://www.namada.help/tutorials?filter=Namada+Keychain).
