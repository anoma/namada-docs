## File System Wallet

The filesystem wallet stores your encrypted keypairs on disk in your Namada base directory. It is the default wallet option when using the Namada CLI "out of the box."

By default, the Namada Wallet is contained in the file `<NAMADA_BASE_DIR>/{chain_id}/wallet.toml`, where keys are stored encrypted. You can change the default base directory path with `--base-dir` and you can allow the storage of unencrypted keypairs with the flag `--unsafe-dont-encrypt`.

If the wallet doesn't already exist, it will be created for you as soon as you run a command that tries to access the wallet, or upon [joining a network](../../networks.mdx).
A newly created wallet will be pre-loaded with some internal addresses like `pos`, `pos_slash_pool`, `masp` and more.

Currently, the Namada client can load the password via:

- **Stdin:** the client will prompt for a password.
- **Env variable:** by exporting a ENV variable called `NAMADA_WALLET_PASSWORD` with a value of the actual password.
- **File:** by exporting an ENV variable called `NAMADA_WALLET_PASSWORD_FILE` with a value containing the path to a file containing the password.

### Common wallet operations

The `namadaw` wallet binary handles all key and wallet management functionality. You can use `namadaw <subcommand> --help` to explore
all available wallet commands.

##### Create a new keypair
This will create a new keypair and save it in your wallet under the provided alias (for convenience). You will be prompted for a
password to encrypt the private key. Afterwards, your mnemonic will be printed to the terminal, which you should safely store in case
you need to restore your key at a later date.

```bash copy
namadaw gen --alias <your alias>
```

<Callout type="warning" emoji="❗">
Write down your mnemonic and store it securely -- this is the only time it will be shown. You can use your mnemonic to recover
your account if you lose access (for example, if your laptop stops working or is stolen). If you are locked out of your account, and
you haven't saved your mnemonic, your funds will be lost forever.  

Also carefully note the encryption password you provided -- you will need to provide it any time you make a transaction.

##### List your addresses
Once you've created a new keypair, you'll want to know the address to which you can send tokens. You do this by listing all known
addresses in your wallet and looking for the alias you've just created:

```bash copy
namadaw list
```

or, if you only want to search for a specific address:

```bash copy
namadaw find --alias <your alias>
```

##### Recover an address from a mnemonic
You can recover an existing key from a mnemonic and add it to your wallet with:
```bash copy
namadaw derive --alias <choose an alias>
```
(You will be prompted to enter the mnemonic).

#### Adding an existing key or address to your wallet

If you know the raw value of a key or address, you can add it to your wallet under an alias so you can more conveniently refer to it later.

```bash copy
namadaw add --alias <choose-an-alias> --value <transparent-secret-key|transparent-public-key|transparent-address|spending-key|viewing-key|payment-address>
```

#### Removing a key/address
You can remove all keys/addresses associated with an alias from your wallet with:
```bash copy
namadaw remove --alias <your-alias> --do-it
```

#### Using the Pregenesis flag
Normally, you will be expected to join a network before using the wallet; and `namadaw` will throw an error when an existing chain context is not found.
However, there may be times when you want to use `namadaw` prior to joining a chain -- for example, when generating a keypair to
recieve a token allotment in the genesis block of a future chain. In these cases, you can use the flag `--pre-genesis` with your `namadaw` commands.
