# Multisignature accounts on Namada

Multisignature accounts (multisigs) are accounts on Namada that allow for multiple signers. There are many benefits to multisignature accounts, including but not limited to: 

- Increased security
- Ability to share wallets
- Better recovery options

For this reason, all established accounts on Namada are multisignature accounts by default.  

A multisignature account can be described as an "**x** *of* **y**" account, where **x** is the 'threshold' or required number of signatures on a transaction
and **y** is the total number of keys associated with the account. For example, a *3 of 5* multisig will need at least three of the parties to sign any transaction.

## Example: Initialising a multisignature account
Here is the process to generate a *2 of 3* multisig account:

<Steps>
### Create three signing keys
Assuming we have three parties -- Alice, Bob, and Charlie -- on the multisig, they each need to first generate their keypairs.
```bash copy
namadaw gen --alias alice
namadaw gen --alias bob
namadaw gen --alias charlie
```

### Fund an implicit account for transaction fees
Recall from the section on [established accounts](./established-accounts.mdx) that we will need to provide an implicit account to
sign and to pay the gas costs of the `init-account` transaction. This can be any account you own, whether or not it's party to the multisig.
In this example, Alice will cover the transaction fees and we'll assume she already has sufficient NAM in her account.

### Init-account
The `init-account` transaction is no different from a typical established account, except for threshold and number of public keys associated.
(In fact, a typical established account is simply a *1 of 1* multisig.)  

The `--signing-keys` flag indicates that Alice is signing and paying fees for this transaction.
```bash copy
namadac init-account --alias abc-multisig\
  --public-keys alice,bob,charlie --threshold 2 \
  --signing-keys alice
```

</Steps>


## Submitting a multisignature transaction
A multisignature transaction requires that an offline transaction first be constructed so that it can be signed by each required party before
being submitted to the chain.

<Steps>
### Dump the raw tx
The `--dump-tx` argument will write the transaction to disk. A folder is required to be specified where the transaction will be dumped (use `.` for the current directory).
Consider the example of a transparent transfer:
```bash copy
namadac transparent-transfer --source abc-multisig --target $TARGET \
  --token nam --amount 2 \
  --dump-tx --output-folder-path . \
  --node $NODE

# Example output:
Transaction serialized to ./9c92fe1f2cdc64956582e69b898101e6df78700968fcad5e88bfc1cdf0a5496d.tx.
```
<Callout type="info">
By default, transactions have an expiration of *1 hour* from the time they're created. This can be changed using the `--expiration` flag and providing a new 
expiration time (in UTC). Transactions submitted after expiry will not be accepted on-chain.
</Callout>

### Sign the transaction with the necessary number of keys (2 in this case)
This command will sign the transaction with Alice's key and Bob's key:

```bash copy
cd tx_dumps
namadac utils sign-offline \
  --data-path 9c92fe1f2cdc64956582e69b898101e6df78700968fcad5e88bfc1cdf0a5496d.tx \
  --secret-keys alice,bob \
```

You should have created two new files -- one with Alice's signature and one with Bob's.
```bash copy
# contents of current directory
9c92fe1f2cdc64956582e69b898101e6df78700968fcad5e88bfc1cdf0a5496d.tx
offline_signature_9c92fe1f2cdc64956582e69b898101e6df78700968fcad5e88bfc1cdf0a5496d_tpknam1qpnpmq2mpxaag9e0xcczgc0w66pzaxvpnhysjsm8h5tgmajgvunwck67w5j.sig
offline_signature_9c92fe1f2cdc64956582e69b898101e6df78700968fcad5e88bfc1cdf0a5496d_tpknam1qqjnwcwpjy09ty4v0z6jwpkr04m3q2h0dgr6j62dfs4g6q6l4dk5yy5we05.sig
```
To make things easier in the next step, we'll save these filenames to the shell variables `TX`, `SIG1` and `SIG2`.

### Submit transaction on-chain
Since we have enough signatures to meet the threshold of this account, we can submit the transaction. Note that we need to specify
an implicit account that will pay the transaction fees.

```bash copy
namadac tx \
  --tx-path $TX \
  --signatures $SIG1 $SIG2 \
  --gas-payer alice --node $NODE
```
<Callout type="info">
Note the lack of commas used in the `--signatures` argument.
</Callout>

</Steps>


## Changing the multisig threshold or associated keys
It is possible to change the multisig threshold of an existing account. This can be done by submitting a valid `update-account` transaction.  

For example, to change the threshold on our multisig to 1:
```shell
namadac update-account \
--address abc-multisig \
--public-keys alice,bob,charlie \
--threshold 1 \
--signing-keys alice,bob --node $NODE
```
<Callout type="info">
Note: you must include both the threshold and the list of public keys to be associated with this account, even if there is no change to one of those values.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ’¡">
Updating an account's threshold or public keys requires submitting a valid transaction meeting the existing requirements -- the `update-account`
transaction is no different from any other transaction in that regard. Therefore, you may need to follow the steps described in the previous section to first dump the `update-account` transaction
to a file and collect the required signatures.
</Callout>

### Querying the threshold and public keys of an account
One can check that the threshold has been updated correctly by running:
```shell
namadac query-account \
--owner abc-multisig --node $NODE
```
This will list the threshold and all associated public keys of an account.
