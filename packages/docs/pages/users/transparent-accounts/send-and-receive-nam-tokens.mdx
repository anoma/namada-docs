# Send and Receive NAM tokens

In Namada, tokens are implemented as accounts with the [Token Validity Predicate](https://github.com/anoma/namada/blob/9b67281e359ebff5467cad57c866fbcf91eb80c8/shared/src/ledger/native_vp/multitoken.rs#L30).
The validity predicate (VP) checks, in particular, that the total supply (of the token) is preserved in any transaction that uses this token. Your wallet will be pre-loaded with some token addresses that are initialized in the genesis block.

### Sending tokens

You can send tokens to/from either an implicit or established account.  

This section will cover transfers from one `tnam...` address to another (tranparent transfers). 
Transfers to/from a `znam...` address (that is, to/from the [MASP](../shielded-accounts.mdx)) are covered in more detail in the section on [shielded transfers](../shielded-accounts/shielded-transfers.mdx).  

<Callout type="info">
For help creating a new account, see the sections on [Generating an implicit account](../transparent-accounts/implicit-accounts.mdx) or [Using the file system wallet](../../users/wallet/file-system-wallet.mdx).
</Callout>

To submit a regular token transfer from your account to the `validator-1` address:

```shell copy
namada client transfer \
  --source <your address or alias> \
  --target <destination address or alias> \
  --token <token alias or address> \
  --amount 10
```

This command will attempt to find and use the key of the source address to sign the transaction.

### See your balance

To query token balances for a specific token and/or owner:

```shell copy
namada client balance --token <token alias or address> --owner <account alias or address>
```

<Callout type="info">
For any client command that submits a transaction (`init-account`, `transfer`, `tx`, `update` and [PoS transactions](../../operators/validators/proof-of-stake.mdx)), 
you can use the `--dry-run-wrapper` flag to simulate the transaction being applied in the block and see what would be the result.
