# Established accounts

Unlike implicit accounts, which exist as soon as the keypair is generated, an established account must be initialized
with an on-chain transaction. It is associated with one or [more](./multisignature.mdx) cryptographic keys.

## Generating an established account

<Callout type="info">
Before submitting the transaction to initialize an established account, you must have created an [implicit](./implicit-accounts.mdx) account and funded it with enough
funds to pay for the transaction [fees](../fees.mdx).
</Callout>

Initializing an established account entails submitting an `init-account` transaction on-chain to associate the account with
one or more public keys. We'll use the aliases `my-implicit` and `my-established` in this example, where the `my-implicit` account is assumed to have been previously been
created and funded.  

We can create a new established account `my-established` and associate it with the public key of `my-implicit` with:
```
namadac init-account --alias my-established --public-keys my-implicit --signing-keys my-implicit --threshold 1
```
Note that:
- the implicit account `my-implicit` is required to sign the init-account transaction and pay the associated fees (with the `--signing-keys` argument)
- One public key is being associated with the account, and the signing threshold is 1. Technically, all established accounts are multisignature accounts
and therefore a 'typical' established account can be considered a '1 of 1' multisignature account. See [here](./multisignature.mdx) 
for further details on using multisignature accounts with multiple keys.
