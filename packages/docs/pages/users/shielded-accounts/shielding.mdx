# Shielding Assets

You can shield assets in the MASP by making a transfer from a transparent address to a shielded address. This is known
as a __shielding transfer__.  

Assets can also be sent directly to a shielded address through IBC -- see the section on [Shielded IBC](../../users/ibc/shielded-ibc.mdx) for details.

## Making a shielding transfer

To conduct a shielding transfer, the user must first be in possession of a transparent account with some token balance.

<Steps>

### Generate a spending key
See [Shielded Key Management](./masp-keys.mdx) for details on how to do this.

### Derive a new shielded address (aka: payment address)
You can (and should) derive multiple shielded addresses for the same spending key.

### Send your shielding transfer
```bash copy
namadac transfer \
  --source <your-transparent-address> \
  --target <your-shielded-address> \
  --token <token-address> \
  --amount <amount-to-shield>
```

</Steps>

### Viewing your balance
To view the up-to-date balance of your spending key (or viewing key), you must first run the `shielded-sync` command to
sync the local shielded context with any MASP notes owned by your spending/viewing key:
```bash copy
namadac shielded-sync --spending-keys <your-spend-key>
```
or
```bash copy
namadac shielded-sync --viewing-keys <your-viewing-key>
```

<Callout>
The first time you wish to check the balance of a spending/viewing key, you must provide it to the shielded context with 
`--spending-keys|--viewing-keys`. On subsequent runs, you can simply use `namadac shielded-sync`.
</Callout>

After the sync has completed, check your balance with:
```bash copy
namadac balance --owner <your-spend-or-viewing-key> --token <token address>
```

This will display the combined balance of all shielded addresses associated with that spending/viewing key.
