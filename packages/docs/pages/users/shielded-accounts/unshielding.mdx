# Unshielding Assets

You can unshield assets in the MASP by making a transfer from a shielded address to a transparent address. This is known as an __unshielding transfer__.

Assets can also be sent directly from a shielded address through IBC -- see the section on Shielded IBC for details.

## Making an unshielding transfer

Before making an unshielding transfer, it is recommended to first sync the local shielded context:
```bash copy
namadac shielded-sync --spending-keys $SPENDING_KEY
```

To make an unshielding transfer, you must possess the relevant spending key. See the [glossary](./glossary.mdx) for
an explanation on the types of keys and addresses used with the MASP.

Use the `unshield` command to make an unshielding transfer to a target transparent (`tnam`) address by providing the spending key associated with a source shielded (`znam`) address:

```bash copy
namadac unshield \
  --source $SPENDING_KEY \
  --target $TRANSPARENT_ACCOUNT \
  --token $TOKEN \
  --amount $AMOUNT \
  --gas-payer $IMPLICIT_ACCOUNT
```

Note: you must provide an implicit account which you control containing funds for transcation fees. This does not have to be
the same as the target.
