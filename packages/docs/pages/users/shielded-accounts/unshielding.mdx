# Unshielding Assets

You can unshield assets in the MASP by making a transfer from a shielded address to a transparent address. This is known as an __unshielding transfer__.

Assets can also be sent directly from a shielded address through IBC -- see the section on Shielded IBC for details.

## Making an unshielding transfer

Before making an unshielding transfer, it is recommended to first sync the local shielded context:
```bash copy
namadac shielded-sync --spending-keys <your-spend-key>
```

To make an unshielding transfer, you must possess the relevant spending key. See the [glossary](./glossary.mdx) for
an explanation on the types of keys and addresses used with the MASP.

```bash copy
namadac transfer \
  --source <your-spend-key> \
  --target <destination-transparent-address> \
  --token <token-address> \
  --amount <amount-to-unshield> \
  --gas-payer <your-implicit-account>
```

Note: you must provide an implicit account you control containing funds for transcation fees. This does not have to be
the same as the target.
