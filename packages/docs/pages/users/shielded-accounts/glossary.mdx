# Glossary

- __Transparent address__:  
Has a `tnam` prefix. When transferring from one transparent address to another, transaction details
such as the sender, receiver and amount are publicly visible.

- __Shielded address (aka: Payment address)__:  
Has a `znam` prefix. This is the public-facing address which can be shared with others in order to receive funds. When transferring from one
shielded address to another, transaction details such as the sender, receiver and amount are hidden from anyone who does not have an associated
spending or viewing key.

- __Spending key__:  
Has a `zsknam` prefix. Authorizes the holder to spend funds from associated shielded address. The spending key is also used to derive the viewing key and payment address.
Therefore, the spending key will also allow the user to view the balance and transaction data of the associated address.

- __Viewing key__:  
Has a `zvknam` prefix. Allows the holder to view incoming and outgoing transactions for a specific shielded address, but does not permit spending funds.
