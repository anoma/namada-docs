# MASP Key Management

This section will detail the commands to generate spending keys, viewing keys and payment addresses with `namadaw`.  

For an explanation of the different types of keys and addresses, see the [glossary](./glossary.mdx).

### Generating a spending key and viewing key

The first step before interacting with the MASP is to create a spending key. A spending key is loosely analogous to the private key you may be familiar with 
from [transparent accounts](../transparent-accounts.mdx), in the sense that it grants one the authority to spend tokens in the associated account (and must always be 
kept secret). Create a new spending key with:
```bash copy
namadaw gen --shielded --alias $SPENDING_KEY_ALIAS
```
<Callout>
This command will also generate a corresponding Viewing Key sharing
the same alias.
</Callout>

You will be prompted to provide an encryption passphrase. Once the key is created, your recovery mnemonic will be displayed in the terminal.
<Callout type="error" emoji="ðŸš¨">
WARNING: Keep your mnemonic and passphrase safe.
Loss of either can result in you being locked out of your accounts with no chance of recovering your funds.
</Callout>

#### Displaying your spending key and viewing key
You can display your viewing key with:
```bash copy
namadaw list --shielded
```

You can also display your spending key (your spending key should always be kept private, so use caution when executing this command):
```bash copy
namadaw list --shielded --unsafe-show-secret --decrypt
```

### Generating a payment address

Once you have created a spending key, it can be used to derive a payment address. A payment address begins with `znam` and is a public-facing address which you can 
share when you wish to receive tokens.
```bash copy
namadaw gen-payment-addr --alias $PAYMENT_ADDRESS_ALIAS --key $SPENDING_KEY_ALIAS
```
<Callout>
It is possible (and recommended) to generate multiple payment addresses from the same spending key.
</Callout>

### Displaying your payment addresses
You can display all payment addresses associated with your spending key(s) with:
```bash copy
namadaw list --shielded
```

### Recovering an existing spending key from mnemonic

You can recover an existing spending key from your mnemonic and add it to your wallet with:
```bash copy
namadaw derive --alias $SPENDING_KEY_ALIAS --shielded
```

### Adding an existing key or payment address to your wallet

If you know the raw value of a spending key, viewing key or payment address, you can add it to your wallet under an alias so you can more conveniently refer to it later.

```bash copy
namadaw add --alias $ALIAS --value $HEX_VALUE
```
where `$HEX_VALUE` is the hex value of a spending key, viewing key or payment address.

### Removing a key/address
You can remove all keys/addresses associated with an alias from your wallet with:
```bash copy
namadaw remove --alias $ALIAS --do-it
```
