# Shielded Rewards

Shielded rewards are distributed to all users in the shielded set. Users are rewared `NAM` tokens for each epoch their incentivised assets are in the shielded set. Informally, the amount of `NAM` rewarded for a specific asset is proportional to the amount of that asset in the shielded pool. Each asset has a "reward rate" specified by governance, which sets the constant of proportionality for that asset. 

The interested reader should consult [the specs](https://specs.namada.net/modules/masp/shielded-pool-incentives) for a more precise explanation of how the reward is calculated.

### Querying eligible assets

You can see a list of assets currently eligible for shielded rewards with:
```bash copy
namadac masp-reward-tokens
```

Assets can be added or removed from eligibility through [governance](../governance/on-chain-governance.mdx).
