# Shielded IBC

You can send assets to another IBC compliant chain, such as a Cosmos SDK chain or another Namada chain, using the
`ibc-transfer` command in `namadac`.

This section covers sending assets to and from a shielded ( `znam` ) address.

## Prerequisites

- An active IBC connection has been created and maintained between the two chains by operators running relayer 
software such as [Hermes](https://github.com/heliaxdev/hermes). 
- You will need to know the corresponding channel id

## IBC transfer to a shielded address
{/* TODO: instructions are out of date? */}

Before sending your IBC transfer, you will need to generate a MASP

Before `namadac ibc-transfer`, you need to generate a proof of the following IBC transfer for the shielding transfer
 to the destination Namada. The command `namadac ibc-gen-shielded` generates the proof and outputs a file including 
 required data. In this case, Chain B is the destination chain.
```bash copy
namadac --base-dir ${BASE_DIR_B} ibc-gen-shielded \
  --output-folder-path ${OUTPUT_PATH} \
  --target ${payment_addr_b} \
  --token apfel \
  --amount 100 \
  --port-id transfer \
  --channel-id channel-0 \
  --node ${LEDGER_ADDRESS_B}
```
Then, you can send the token from the source chain by setting the proof in the ICS-20 packet's memo field. 
The following example is to send tokens from the source Namada (Chain A). The `${memo_path}` should be the file 
path created by `namadac ibc-gen-shielded` on the destination chain.
```bash copy
namadac --base-dir ${BASE_DIR_A} ibc-transfer \
  --source ${spending_key_a} \
  --receiver ${payment_addr_b} \
  --token apfel \
  --amount 100 \
  --channel-id channel-0 \
  --memo-path ${memo_path} \
  --node ${LEDGER_ADDRESS_A}
```

When the source chain is a Cosmos-SDK based chain, the memo should be set as string with `--memo` option.
```bash copy
memo=$(cat ${memo_path})
gaiad tx ibc-transfer transfer \
  ${CHANNEL_ID} \
  ${RECEIVER_PAYMENT_ADDRESS} \
  ${AMOUNT}${IBC_TOKEN_ADDRESS} \
  --from ${COSMOS_ALIAS} \
  --memo ${memo} \
  --node ${COSMOS_RPC_ENDPOINT} \
  --fees 5000uatom
```

You can do unshielding transfers over IBC without generating a proof.
```bash copy
namadac --base-dir ${BASE_DIR_A} ibc-transfer \
  --source ${spending_key_a} \
  --receiver ${RECEIVER_RAW_ADDRESS} \
  --token nam \
  --amount 100 \
  --channel-id channel-0 \
  --node ${LEDGER_ADDRESS_A}
```
