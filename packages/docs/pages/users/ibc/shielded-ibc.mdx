# Shielded IBC

You can send assets to another IBC compliant chain, such as a Cosmos SDK chain or another Namada chain, using the
`ibc-transfer` command in `namadac`.

This section covers sending assets to and from a shielded ( `znam` ) address.

## Prerequisites

- An active IBC connection has been created and maintained between the two chains by operators running relayer 
software such as [Hermes](https://github.com/heliaxdev/hermes). 
- You will need to know the corresponding channel ID.

## IBC transfer to a shielded address

First, we need to generate the shielding data with the command:

```bash copy
namadac ibc-gen-shielding \
  --output-folder-path \
  $OUTPUT_FOLDER_PATH \
  --target \
  $RECEIVER \
  --token \
  $TOKEN \
  --amount \
  $AMOUNT \
  --port-id
  $PORT_ID \
  --channel-id \
  $CHANNEL_ID
```

This command will generate the shielding data in a file inside the provided directory and will output the path to this file, `$SHIELDING_DATA_PATH`.

After that, IBC transfers to a shielded address work similarly to those for a [transparent address](./transparent-ibc.mdx), 
the only differences being that we provide the MASP internal address as the value instead of `$RECV_ADDRESS` and we add a `--memo` arg with the path to the file we have just generated:

```bash copy
gaiad tx ibc-transfer transfer \
  $CHANNEL_ID \
  $MASP_ADDRESS \
  ${AMOUNT}${IBC_TOKEN_ADDRESS} \
  --from $COSMOS_ALIAS \
  --node $COSMOS_RPC_ENDPOINT \
  --fees 5000uatom \
  --memo $SHIELDING_DATA_PATH
```

<Callout>
The previous command would work even with `$RECEIVER_PAYMENT_ADDRESS` as the second argument, but it is highly recommended to use `$MASP_ADDRESS` to preserve privacy.
</Callout>

## IBC transfer from a shielded address

You can also send IBC transfers from a shielded address, by providing the associated spending key as the source:
```bash copy
namadac ibc-transfer \
  --source $SOURCE_SPEND_KEY \
  --receiver $RECV_ADDRESS \
  --token $TOKEN \
  --amount $AMOUNT \
  --channel-id $CHANNEL_ID \
```

Gas fees can be paid like all the other transactions either directly from an implicit account adding `--gas-payer $IMPLICIT_ADDRESS` or via the MASP.
For more information please refer to the [fees section](../fees.mdx).

### Refund when IBC transfer failure
The token should be refunded when the IBC transfer fails.

`--refund-target` can be set to specify the address to be refunded only if you send tokens from a shielded address. In a transparent IBC transfer, tokens will be refunded to the source address.

The refund target address will receive the refund if `--refund-target` is given. You can set only a transparent address for the refund target. Please note that this address should be disposable not to leak infromation.

If no `--refund-target` is given in a transfer from a shielded address, a generated transparent address whose alias is prefixed with `ibc-refund-target` and the token will be refunded to the transparent address.
