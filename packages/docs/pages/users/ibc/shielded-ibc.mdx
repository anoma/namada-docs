# Shielded IBC

You can send assets to another IBC compliant chain, such as a Cosmos SDK chain or another Namada chain, using the
`ibc-transfer` command in `namadac`.

This section covers sending assets to and from a shielded ( `znam` ) address.

## Prerequisites

- An active IBC connection has been created and maintained between the two chains by operators running relayer 
software such as [Hermes](https://github.com/heliaxdev/hermes). 
- You will need to know the corresponding channel ID.

## IBC transfer to a shielded address

First, we need to generate the shielding data with the command:

```bash copy
namadac ibc-gen-shielding \
  --output-folder-path \
  $OUTPUT_FOLDER_PATH \
  --target \
  $RECEIVER \
  --token \
  $TOKEN \
  --amount \
  $AMOUNT \
  --port-id
  $PORT_ID \
  --channel-id \
  $CHANNEL_ID
```

This command will generate the shielding data in a file inside the provided directory and will output the path to this file, `$SHIELDING_DATA_PATH`.

After that, IBC transfers to a shielded address work similarly to those for a [transparent address](./transparent-ibc.mdx), 
the only differences being that we provide the MASP internal address as the value instead of `$RECV_ADDRESS` and we add a `--memo` arg with the path to the file we have just generated:

```bash copy
gaiad tx ibc-transfer transfer \
  $CHANNEL_ID \
  $MASP_ADDRESS \
  ${AMOUNT}${IBC_TOKEN_ADDRESS} \
  --from $COSMOS_ALIAS \
  --node $COSMOS_RPC_ENDPOINT \
  --fees 5000uatom \
  --memo $SHIELDING_DATA_PATH
```

<Callout>
The previous command would work even with `$RECEIVER_PAYMENT_ADDRESS` as the second argument, but it is highly recommended to use `$MASP_ADDRESS` to preserve privacy.
</Callout>

## IBC transfer from a shielded address

You can also send IBC transfers from a shielded address, by providing the associated spending key as the source:
```bash copy
namadac ibc-transfer \
  --source $SOURCE_SPEND_KEY \
  --receiver $RECV_ADDRESS \
  --token $TOKEN \
  --amount $AMOUNT \
  --channel-id $CHANNEL_ID \
```

Gas fees can be paid like all the other transactions either directly from an implicit account adding `--gas-payer $IMPLICIT_ADDRESS` or via the MASP.
For more information please refer to the [fees section](../fees.mdx).

### Refund when IBC transfer failure
The token should be refunded when the IBC transfer fails.

`--refund-target` can be set to specify the address to be refunded only if you send tokens from a shielded address. In a transparent IBC transfer, tokens will be refunded to the source address.

The refund target address will receive the refund if `--refund-target` is given. You can set a transparent or a payment address for the refund target.

If no `--refund-target` is given in a transfer from a shielded address, a generated transparent address whose alias is prefixed with `ibc-refund-target` and the token will be refunded to the transparent address.

Please note that it is impossible to refund to the payment address when the refund happens after the MASP epoch when the transfer has started. In this case, the tokens will be refunded to the fallback transparent address that is automatically generated when a payment address is set to the refund target.
