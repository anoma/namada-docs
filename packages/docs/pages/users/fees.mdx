# Fees on Namada

In order to settle the market for Namada blockspace demand, fees are coupled with transactions.
In order for any namada transaction to be considered valid, the correct corresponding fee must be paid.
The exact fee is set by the user, and must be greater than or equal to the minimum `gas-price` set by governance, which is included in the genesis file under `gas_cost`.

## How fees are paid

Fees are **always** paid from the balance of an **implicit** address. When explicitly stated, the gas fee is paid by the `--gas-payer` flag.
If no `--gas-payer` flag is specified, the gas fee is paid by the first key in the `--signing-keys` flag, if those are specified.
If no `--signing-keys` flag is specified, the client will try to infer the signer from the source of the transaction and use that account as the fee payer.

First consider the example of a simple transfer: 
```shell copy
namadac transparent-transfer \
  --source my-acc \
  --target validator-1 \
  --token NAM \
  --amount 10 \
```

With no `--gas-payer` or `--signing-keys` explicitly provided, the client will infer the proper account related to `my-acc` from which to take the fees.
If `my-acc` is an implicit address, the fees will be taken directly from it.
If it is an established address, the fees will be taken from the implicit address associated with `my-acc` (usually the account used to initialize the established address).

However, another gas payer can be specified in this transaction by providing another implicit address for which the user owns the private key:
```shell copy
namadac transparent-transfer \
  --source my-acc \
  --target validator-1 \
  --token NAM \
  --amount 10 \
  --gas-payer my-other-acc
```

Now consider the example of a transfer from a 2-of-n multisignature account:
```shell copy
namadac transparent-transfer \
  --source my-multisig \
  --target validator-1 \
  --token NAM \
  --amount 10 \
  --signing-keys key1,key2
```

In this case, the fees will be taken from the first key provided to `--signing-keys`: `key1`.
As before, any gas payer can be specified by supplying the desired key to the `--gas-payer` argument like such:
```shell copy
namadac transparent-transfer \
  --source my-multisig \
  --target validator-1 \
  --token NAM \
  --amount 10 \
  --signing-keys key1,key2 \
  --gas-payer key2
```

For testnet purposes, we recommend [using the faucet](../networks/testnets/faucet.mdx) to source NAM for transaction fees.

## How fees are calculated

The fee for a transaction is calculated by multiplying `gas-limit` by the gas price.
Both the `--gas-limit` and the `--gas-price` can be specified by the user. If neither is specified, the default gas limit and minimum gas price is used.
The default gas limit for any transaction is currently set to `50_000`.

The minimum gas price is set in the genesis file under `minimum_gas_price`.
One can query the minimum gas prices for all tokens accepted for gas payment in a network with:
```shell copy
namadac query-protocol-parameters
```

## How to set the gas price and gas limit

It is recommended to set the `gas-limit` based on the transaction being conducted. In order to estimate the `gas-limit` for a particular transaction, the `--dry-run-wrapper` argument should be provided. This means that the transaction is simulated, but not yet sent to the ledger. 

For example, the following command will simulate a transfer transaction, and return the gas used:

```shell copy
namadac transfer \
  --source my-acc \
  --target validator-1 \
  --token NAM \
  --amount 10 \
  --signing-keys key1 \
  --dry-run-wrapper
```

Which will output something along the lines of 

```md
Dry-run result: Transaction consumed 14850 gas. Inner transaction <tx-hash> was successfully applied.
```
This means that we could reasonably make this transfer transaction with a `gas-limit` of 15000.

Hence, when making the transfer, we could specify the `gas-limit` as follows:

```shell copy
namadac transfer \
  --source my-acc \
  --target validator-1 \
  --token NAM \
  --amount 10 \
  --signing-keys key1 \
  --gas-limit 15000
```

If for some reason, we wanted to pay a higher gas fee, we could also specify that as follows:

```shell copy
namadac transfer \
  --source my-acc \
  --target validator-1 \
  --token NAM \
  --amount 10 \
  --signing-keys key1 \
  --gas-limit 15000 \
  --gas-price 0.01
```

This **might** incentivise validators to prioritise this transaction above those with a lower gas price.

## Paying fees with tokens in the MASP

It is also possible to pay for fees using the MASP when dealing with a transfer transaction involving shielded inputs (shielded, and unshielding transfers both natively and with IBC): this is required to prevent information leakage that could defy the purpose of the shielded pool.

When dealing with MASP fee payment, the client will try to deduct the fees from the spending key specfied by `--gas-spending-key` of the shielded transaction and unshield them to the transparent balance of the `--gas-payer` (or the address corresponding to the first key in the `--signing-keys`) before being paid to the block proposer.

For example, if the user has a spending key `spending-key-1` in their wallet, and they want to pay for the fees of a shielded transfer transaction using the MASP, they would run the following command:

```shell copy 
namadac transfer \
  --source spending-key-1 \
  --target payment-addr-b \
  --token OSMO \
  --amount 10 \
  --gas-payer my-implicit \
  --gas-spending-key spending-key-1
```

If `spending-key-1` does not have enough balance or the user simply wants to use a separate key for gas, they can specify a different spending key for fee payment:

```shell copy 
namadac transfer \
  --source spending-key-1 \
  --target payment-addr-b \
  --token OSMO \
  --amount 10 \
  --gas-payer my-implicit \
  --gas-spending-key spending-key-2
```

In these examples, `my-implicit` may only have an OSMO balance in their transparent balance, but `spending-key-1` (or possibly `spending-key-2`) may have a positive NAM balance in their shielded balance.
In this case, the NAM will be unshielded to the transparent balance of `my-implicit` and then used to pay for the transaction fee.
So it is requried to unshield just the difference between the gas cost and the transparent balance of the gas payer implicit address.

### Using a disposable gas payer (recommended)

It is also possible to use a disposable gas payer to pay for transaction fees.
This is useful (and recommended) in cases where the user does not want to leak information and reveal the identity of the `--gas-payer` to prevent correlation.
In order to use a disposable gas payer, the user must include the `--disposable-gas-payer` flag.
The fees will be deducted from the shielded balance of the shielded transactions `--gas-spending-key` and unshielded to the transparent balance of an ephemeral transparent address before being paid by the ephemeral address.

For example, if the user has the same two spending keys from the previous example in their wallet, and they want to pay for the fees of an unshield transfer transaction using a disposable address, they would run the following command:

```shell copy
namadac unshield \
  --source spending-key-1 \
  --target addr-b \
  --token OSMO \
  --amount 10 \
  --gas-spending-key spending-key-2 \
  --disposable-gas-payer
```

### MASP fee payment gas limit

To prevent spamming the network, the protocol establishes a maximum gas limit (`masp_fee_payment_gas_limit`) that can be used when fees are paid via the MASP (this limit applies to the gas used to run the transaction and the validity predicates but does not apply to the gas used by the wrapper transaction). It can be queried with:

```bash copy
namadac query-protocol-parameters
```

If the transaction exceeds this limit it won't be accepted: the protocol sets a value which should allow for most transactions to be accepted. Should the user be in need to submit a more complex (and therefore gas-demanding) transaction, there are two ways around it, both taking advantage of the fact that the protocol gas limit only applies to the first transaction of the batch.

1. The user can submit a batch of two transactions: the first one just unshield the necessary funds to pay fees for the entire batch whereas the second transaction applies the desired transfer. Since the protocol gas limit only applies to the first transaction of the batch (the one paying fees), the second transaction is free from this limit and can be as complex as required (withing the size and gas limits of the entire block)
2. The user submit a first transaction paying fees via the MASP. This time though, the transaction unshields an amount which is enough to cover both the gas fees of itself and of the desired masp transaction. After this, the gas payer of the first transaction will still have a transparent balance large enough to cover fees for a second masp transaction that actually performs the desired transfer and does not require any more fee unshielding.

<Callout type="info">
The firt solution proposed above is currently not supported by the CLI client and requires direct usage of the SDK. 
</Callout>

Each of these solutions has its own advanatages and drawbacks compared to the other one. Using a single batch with two transactions allows for faster confirmation times and lower gas costs (since a batch will cost less than two separate transactions), but because of the way the SDK builds MASP transactions it could fail sometimes (specifically the SDK invalidates notes that have been spent by the first transaction in the batch which could cause a lack of funds for the second one). Using two separate transactions instead, avoids this issue (since the user can call `shielded-sync` after the first one to recollect all the available funds), but requires more gas overall and longer confirmation times.

<Callout type="warning">
It is also possible, using either of the two solutions presetend above, to use MASP fee payment to pay fees for non-MASP transactions. Please note that this is discouraged since it could establish a linkage between the masp transaction and the entity behind that.
