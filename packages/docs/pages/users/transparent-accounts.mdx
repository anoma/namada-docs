# An Introduction to Namada Addresses

All accounts in Namada have a unique address, exactly one Validity Predicate and optionally any additional data in its dynamic storage sub-space.

There are currently 3 types of account addresses:
- **Implicit:** An implicit account is the simplest account type. It is derived from a keypair and can be used to authorize certain transactions such as sending and staking tokens, or paying [fees](./fees.mdx).
Implicit accounts have no code attached to them, and can only have one key controlling it. This differs it from established accounts,
which can support multiple keys.
- **Established:** Unlike implicit accounts, which exist as soon as the keypair is generated, an established account must be initialized
with an on-chain transaction. It is associated with one or [more](./transparent-accounts/multisignature.mdx) cryptographic keys. An established account
has the `vp_user` validity predicate which validates any associated transaction to ensure that the multisignature threshold is correctly met.
- **Internal:** These are special internal accounts, such as those for the protocol parameters, proof of stake and IBC modules.

## Managing keypairs

Namada uses [ed25519](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EdDSA#Ed25519) keypairs for signing cryptographic operations on the blockchain.

The `namadaw` binary is used for key management. Various sub-commands are available under:

```shell copy
namadaw --help
```
