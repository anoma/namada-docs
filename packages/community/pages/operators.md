# Operators

Validators or operators of the protocol play a crucial role in the community. In decentralized systems

The development of Namada started in 2022, back then it went by the codename of “M1”. After months of development, throughout summer and fall we launched a series of private testnets with the help of a handful of early validators who believed in the vision of bringing asset agnostic privacy. The community at this stage was composed by the core developers at Heliax and the few validators (7 team members from Heliax and 11 validators) who joined and coordinated through the Validator Hangout on Element. The last private testnets ran until December 2022, the protocol version was `v0.11`.

In December 2022, the first public testnet was launched with a few more validators joining forces (29 in total, with a few team-run nodes). Ever since, the core developers have published numerous protocol releases from `v0.12.0`, until the latest `v0.23.0` and more than 13 testnets launches/upgrades. The number of validators grew a lot, a total of 253 validators submitted their genesis keys for testnet 13.

Every testnet followed the same decentralized launch process as practice for mainnet, where a protocol version and a genesis proposal is published, and it is entirely up to the validators whether the network goes live or not.
