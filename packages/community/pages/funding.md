## RPGF 0

In December 2022 the Anoma Foundation announced that at least 20% of Namada’s genesis will be allocated to the public goods built by teams and individuals in the Zcash, Ethereum, and Cosmos ecosystems - on which the Namada protocol is built. Additionally, we invited individuals to submit nominations to the Namada forum for individuals and groups who contributed to privacy research, implementation, advocacy, meetups, or creators of art and fiction that help spread the awareness around surveillance. A total of XX nominations were submitted, some past the deadline of 30th of March 2023.
