# Namada Community DOCS

## What is the Namada Community?

The Namada community is composed of ecosystems, communities, researchers, builders, creators, advocates, users of privacy, and just people â€“ who want to see a future in which decentralized systems can serve as real alternatives to existing financial systems. To achieve this, privacy is paramount.

We are brought together by the Namada Vision. Together we make privacy as a public good a reality by building open-source tools, operating protocols, teaching people about privacy, using privacy, and funding privacy.
