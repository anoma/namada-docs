# Namada Community DOCS

## What is the Namada Community?

The Namada community is composed of ecosystems, communities, researchers, builders, creators, advocates, users of privacy, and just people – who want to see a future in which decentralized systems can serve as real alternatives to existing financial systems. To achieve this, privacy is paramount.

We are brought together by the [Namada Vision](https://forum.namada.net/t/the-namada-mission/275). Together we make privacy as a public good a reality by building open-source tools, operating protocols, teaching people about privacy, using privacy, and funding privacy.
