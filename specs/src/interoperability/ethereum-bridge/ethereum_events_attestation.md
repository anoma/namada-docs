# Ethereum Events Attestation

We want to store events from the smart contracts of our bridge onto Namada. We
will include events that have been seen by at least one validator, but will not
act on them until they have been seen by at least 2/3 of voting power.

There will be multiple types of events emitted. Validators should
ignore improperly formatted events. Raw events from Ethereum are converted to a
Rust enum type (`EthereumEvent`) by Namada validators before being included
in vote extensions or stored on chain.

```rust
pub enum EthereumEvent {
    // we will have different variants here corresponding to different types
    // of raw events we receive from Ethereum
    TransfersToNamada(Vec<TransferToNamada>)
    // ...
}
```

Each event will be stored with a list of the validators that have ever seen it
as well as the fraction of total voting power that has ever seen it.
Once an event has been seen by 2/3 of voting power, it is locked into a
`seen` state, and acted upon.

There is no adjustment across epoch boundaries - e.g. if an event is seen by 1/3
of voting power in epoch n, then seen by a different 1/3 of voting power in
epoch m>n, the event will be considered `seen` in total. Validators may never
vote more than once for a given event.

## Minimum confirmations
There will be a protocol-specified minimum number of confirmations that events
must reach on the Ethereum chain, before validators can vote to include them
on Namada. This minimum number of confirmations will be changeable via
governance.

`TransferToNamada` events may include a custom minimum number of
confirmations, that must be at least the protocol-specified minimum number of
confirmations but is initially set to __100__.

Validators must not vote to include events that have not met the required
number of confirmations. Voting on unconfirmed events is considered a
slashable offence.

## Storage
To make including new events easy, we take the approach of always overwriting
the state with the new state rather than applying state diffs. The storage
keys involved are:
```
# all values are Borsh-serialized
/eth_msgs/\$msg_hash/body : EthereumEvent
/eth_msgs/\$msg_hash/seen_by : BTreeSet<Address>
/eth_msgs/\$msg_hash/voting_power: (u64, u64)  # reduced fraction < 1 e.g. (2, 3)
/eth_msgs/\$msg_hash/seen: bool
```

`\$msg_hash` is the SHA256 digest of the Borsh serialization of the relevant
`EthereumEvent`.

Changes to this `/eth_msgs` storage subspace are only ever made by
nodes as part of the ledger code based on the aggregate of votes
by validators for specific events. That is, changes to
`/eth_msgs` happen
in block `n` in a deterministic manner based on the votes included in the
block proposal for block `n`. Depending on the underlying CometBFT
version, these votes will either be included as vote extensions or as
protocol transactions.

The `/eth_msgs` storage subspace will belong
to the `EthBridge` validity predicate. It should disallow any changes to
this storage from wasm transactions.

### Including events into storage

For every Namada block proposal, block proposer should include the votes for
events from other validators into their proposal. If the underlying CometBFT
version supports vote extensions, consensus invariants guarantee that a
quorum of votes from the previous block height can be included. Otherwise,
validators can only submit votes by broadcasting protocol transactions,
which comes with less guarantees (i.e. no consensus finality).

The vote of a validator should include the events of the Ethereum blocks they
have seen via their full node such that:
1. It's correctly formatted.
2. It's reached the required number of confirmations on the Ethereum chain

Each event that a validator is voting to include must be individually signed by
them. If the validator is not voting to include any events, they must still
provide a signed empty vector of events to indicate this.

The votes will include be a Borsh-serialization of something like
the following.
```rust
/// This struct will be created and signed over by each
/// active validator, to be included as a vote extension at the end of a
/// CometBFT PreCommit phase or as Protocol Tx.
pub struct Vext {
    /// The block height for which this [`Vext`] was made.
    pub block_height: BlockHeight,
    /// The address of the signing validator
    pub validator_addr: Address,
    /// The new ethereum events seen. These should be
    /// deterministically ordered.
    pub ethereum_events: Vec<EthereumEvent>,
}
```

These votes will be given to the next block proposer who will
aggregate those that it can verify and will inject a signed protocol
transaction into their proposal.

Validators will check this transaction and the validity of the new votes as
part of `ProcessProposal`, this includes checking:
- signatures
- that votes are really from active validators
- the calculation of backed voting power

If vote extensions are supported, it is also checked that each vote extension
came from the previous round, requiring validators to sign over the Namada block
height with their vote extension. Signing over the block height also acts as 
a replay protection mechanism.

Furthermore, the vote extensions included by the block proposer should have 
a quorum of the total voting power of the epoch of the block height behind 
it. Otherwise the block proposer would not have passed the `FinalizeBlock` 
phase of the last round of the last block.

These checks are to prevent censorship
of events from validators by the block proposer. If vote extensions are not
enabled, unfortunately these checks cannot be made.

In `FinalizeBlock`, we derive a second transaction (the "state update"
transaction) from the vote aggregation that:
- calculates the required changes to `/eth_msgs` storage and applies it
- acts on any `/eth_msgs/\$msg_hash` where `seen` is going from `false` to `true`
  (e.g. appropriately minting wrapped Ethereum assets)

This state update transaction will not be recorded on chain but will be
deterministically derived from the protocol transaction including the
aggregation of votes, which is recorded on chain.  All ledger nodes will
derive and apply the appropriate state changes to their own local
blockchain storage.

The value of `/eth_msgs/\$msg_hash/seen` will also indicate if the event
has been acted upon on the Namada side. The appropriate transfers of tokens
to the given user will be included on chain free of charge and requires no
additional actions from the end user.
